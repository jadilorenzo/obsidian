Positioned strategically near the heart of the Atlantic Ocean, THE NEMESIS — an anarchist vessel — silently completed its last system check of the ship’s most dangerous weapon, an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) weapon. This weapon
While traditional EMP weapons are about the size of a suitcase, this monstrosity was the size of a small car, taking up more than half of the deck space on THE NEMESIS. Etched on the side of the ship, just below the ship's name, was the vessel's motto: "Cras Mors Venit," which translates to "Tomorrow we die.”

As the appointed time for detonation arrived amid the final preparations, near silent anticipation filled the air as the crew prepared to witness the “definitive,” as they called it, eradication of electrical technology — a menace that had plagued the world for centuries. At precisely 9:59:59 AM, the EMP weapon unleashed its devastating power, sending forth an electromagnetic pulse that raced through the vast expanse of space at the speed of light. In 0.133 seconds, this overwhelming wave of electromagnetic energy engulfed the entire surface of the globe, obliterating all electronic components in its path.

Moments later, without warning, THE NEMESIS erupted into a colossal fireball, vanishing in a blaze of destruction from the seascape.

Many said they were the lucky ones.

As the invisible wave of the EMP raced across the globe, skylines instantly went dark, and the world's technological infrastructure crumbled in an instant. The dazzling screens that once commanded attention in every household turned into gaping black mirrors. Cars stalled on highways, their electronic brains fried. The hum of electricity that had become the backdrop of modern life fell into an eerie silence.
