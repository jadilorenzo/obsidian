## Chapter 1: Nothing is Fair in War

*"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.”*

![[EMP Introduction Scene]]

A century later, the world had changed. Contrary to visions of aliens, spaceships, and teleportation, the world was not somehow bizarre. It was dangerous.

With the abrupt cessation of the technological symphony that had been the modern world, the landscape transformed. Once-proud skyscrapers, monuments to human achievement, now stood as silent sentinels against the backdrop of green, wooded hills. ***

“First time on a lightning train?” asked an attendant in a dark blue uniform and jacket. The uniform and jacket were without adornment — or even a second color to break the rich flow of dark blue other than a white symbol on his chest, the same symbol printed on every banner, engraved into the side of every car of the lightning train, and glowing from every magnetic binding. The symbol was a_____.

An unexpected boon had emerged from the destruction of computer chips: new technology no longer relied on antiquated systems. Fiberglass microchips replaced their silicon predecessors, and copper wiring gave way to the blazing speed of fiberglass wire. Previous computers had been fast, but these new machines were limited only by the speed of light. Systems initially designed for the interception of intercontinental ballistic missiles could achieve their goal with relative ease. This boost to computing speed combined with discoveries in the arena of magnetic shields and blades. Depending on the size and variety, these shields could deflect up to full-blown tank shells, metal or not. The edges, or more technically destructive magnetic fields, could easily tear through sheet metal. However, when brought to bear in hand-to-hand combat, each blade counteracted the other.

"Headed to Novar?" The merchant posed the question, his hand casually resting on the hilt of a short sword hanging from his belt. But to call it a “sword” would do the weapon little justice.

According to the day's standards, it was a relatively high-end weapon. Though in terms of salary, it was the price equivalent of a luxury SUV. ————

Alan, a man of twenty hard years’ worth of intensity in his gaze, met the stranger's audacious intrusion with a tightened jaw. "Yes," he confirmed, his tone even.

The stranger leaned in, unperturbed by Alan's blank stare. "Tournament contender, perhaps?"

"No," he stated matter of factly. "It’s unnecessary exposure. Worthy soldiers are smarter than that."

Disappointed with Alan's response, the merchant dropped the conversation, and they both continued their walk silent amid the hubbub of conversation on the rocky mountain path that led toward Novar.

As Alan walked, the state of the world was often on his mind. The days of unified nations were long gone, replaced by a patchwork of city-states and powerful corporations that governed their territories. The strong ruled without mercy, and the weak struggled to survive under the shadow of war, execution, or starvation. Trust was rare and power was the ultimate currency.

Far before the merchant had spoken, Alan had taken stock of every weapon on the hillside, instinctively assessing all potential threats or weaknesses, from the merchant’s short sword to the concealed knife on a relatively elderly man fifty yards distant. It was a habit ingrained in him from a lifetime of guarding the defenseless and stepping in when the odds seemed insurmountable.

Alan was born an orphan in a violent world, and he looked the part. Alan was of an agile build and wore tight-fitting, flexible brown fabric blending into black, accompanied by dark metal armor adorning his shins and forearms to preserve the utmost flexibility and agility. He was covered in dirt and grime from his cloak to his boots.

Alan was a master of combat _and_ technology. A tall staff of dark seamless metal rested, magnetically suspended on his back, ready to be drawn at a moment's notice. It was more than a quarterstaff of medieval times.

An unexpected boon had emerged from the destruction of computer chips: new technology no longer relied on antiquated systems. Fiberglass microchips replaced their silicon predecessors, and copper wiring gave way to the blazing speed of fiberglass wire. Previous computers had been fast, but these new machines were limited only by the speed of light. Systems initially designed for the interception of intercontinental ballistic missiles could achieve their goal with relative ease. This boost to computing speed combined with discoveries in the arena of magnetic shields and blades. Depending on the size and variety, these shields could deflect up to full-blown tank shells, metal or not. The edges, or more technically destructive magnetic fields, could easily tear through sheet metal. However, when brought to bear in hand-to-hand combat, each blade counteracted the other.

Alan utilized these technologies as the primary mechanism in his staff in addition to a plethora of customizations. A low-profile, personal hologram overlay computer rested over his left year, providing additional information to his eyes. Nor was Alan the only one carrying a weapon on the path to Novar.

Novar stood, a formidable fortress, its grandeur evident in every aspect. A massive wall encircled the city, serving as a conspicuous defense against potential invaders. However, since the beginning of the Novar festival, the protective shield enveloping Novar's airspace, typically inconspicuous, brilliantly filled the sky. Multitudes of military-grade surveillance drones monitored the city, and every last one was necessary.

Their purpose was twofold. The first was to spy on any new technology that entered the city. Governor Marcus Kane knew that information is power, and was willing to play that card for all it was worth. The second was to prevent crime among the hoards of newcomers more often than not armed to the teeth.

The Novar festival was centered on its famous tournament. Hundreds of worthy competitors came to participate. Thousands of substantially less worthy miscreants flooded the city in search of prey. Though the Novar security force could arrive on the scene within the minute, they had not mastered the ancient arts of Sherlock Holmes. Thus, most crimes had become hit-and-run ordeals.

If one had temporary omniscience, one would have noticed two things happen simultaneously on that forest trail. First, Alan, whose conversation had ended in silence a minute before, focused his eyes on the distance and silently vanished into the crowd. Second, fifty yards ahead, a man in a flamboyant blue and gold cape, not unusual garb for a tournament participant, drew a hand-held taser from his pocket which he concealed in his palm.

Several paces ahead an elderly but vivacious man of about seventy years of age tottered along surrounded by a swarm of various matching attendants and aids wearing white and baby-blue. The man in the gold and blue cape saw his opportunity.

With measured steps, he approached the elderly man, a smile curving his lips as he offered a veneer of polite service. His voice was honeyed. “My dear sir…”

The old man's gaze met his, and for an instant, time seemed to pause as the old man looked up in gentle expectation. In the next breath, the man collapsed, his descent to the ground eerily silent, leaving all but one of his attendants frozen in shock.

Almost as soon as the old man’s unconscious body hit the ground, one seemingly unassuming attendant sprang into action. Nothing about this man's appearance would have suggested action. If one had to describe the smooth face and intelligent eyes behind his round glasses, one would have thought he had never seen the world outside his mental landscape.

He lunged forward with a remarkable burst of swiftness, intercepting the concealed knife mid-air as it ricocheted off the ground. The weapon had slipped from the old man's coat amidst the chaos.

Without hesitation, the attendant in white rushed toward the cape-wearing man. The latter discarded the miniature taser in favor of a drawn sword, the single edge glowed a faint blue in the dappled sunlight.

But the man in the blue cape was prepared for such situations. With a swift motion, he stood and drew a sword from a hidden sheath.

However, the sound of steel on steel was inconsistent. In addition to the irregular sound of a sword versus knife, the blades often wouldn’t even meet, the magnetic fields stopping the blades only millimeters away.

The struggle between the two men was intense, drawing the attention of the onlookers. The hubbub of conversation turned into gasps and murmurs as the scene unfolded. The forest path became a battleground of its own, the skirmish contrasting starkly with the peaceful surroundings.

Amidst the chaos, a shriveled man, barely noticeable in the crowd, crawled through the throng of spectators. His gnarled fingers reached out, his eyes fixed on a small, square-inch-sized jewel hanging from the old man's belt. The credit token,
