## 0: Cras Mors Venit

Positioned fifty kilometers off the coast of California, THE NEMESIS — an anarchist vessel — silently completed its last system check of the ship’s most dangerous weapon, an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) with a range of over 100 kilometers, surpassing any before it.

Etched on the ship's side, just below its name, was the vessel's motto: "Cras Mors Venit," which translates to "Tomorrow we die.”

Anarchy wasn’t a revolution; it was a bomb. The NEMESIS was the spark.

EMPs have the capacity to violently overload circuitry by causing voltage spikes that fry both capacitors and the now unprotected components. Frying the central nervous system of the western hemisphere was calculated to start WWIII.

Near silent anticipation filled the air as the crew prepared to witness the detonation. At precisely 9:59:59 AM, the EMP weapon unleashed its devastating power.

But there had been a slight miscalculation.

The engineers of this weapon hadn’t accounted for the pulse ricocheting off the inside of the atmosphere which multiplied the force of the pulse over seventeen times. Within 0.133 seconds, this wave of electromagnetic energy engulfed the surface of the globe.

As the invisible wave of the EMP raced across the globe, skylines instantly went dark and the world's technological infrastructure crumbled. Instantly. The dazzling screens that once commanded attention in every household became lifeless, gaping black mirrors. Cars stalled on highways, their electronic brains fried. The crackle of electricity that had become the backdrop of modern life fell into an eerie moment of silence — a silence soon filled with screams.

## 1: Nothing is Fair in War

"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.”
— Sherlock Holmes

“Stop the train.” Alan said as he stood up.

The silence after the EMP was deafening.  Then came the screams.

A century later, the world was dangerous… not fantastical — no aliens, no spaceships, no teleportation. Alan wasn’t the only one wearing armor.

The days of unified nations were long gone, replaced by a patchwork of large city-states and powerful corporations that governed their territories. The strong ruled without mercy; the weak, without hope — hope to survive under the shadow of war, execution, starvation, or assassination. Trust was rare.

Nevertheless, humans always adapt. In fact, an unexpected benefit had emerged from the destruction of computer chips: new technology no longer relied on old infrastructure. Fiber optic microchips replaced their silicon predecessors, and copper wiring gave way to the blazing speed of fiber optic wire. Previous computers had been fast, but these new machines were only limited by the speed of light. This boost to computing speed, combined with discoveries in the arenas of magnetic deflection and magnetic blade technology, reverted all combat to hand-to-hand. Bullets were useless. Depending on the size and variety, these shields could deflect full-blown tank shells, metal or otherwise. The  blade edges could tear through sheet metal. But when brought to bear in hand-to-hand combat, each blade counteracted the other. Decapitation was as effortless as a single, well-placed stroke of a blade.

Alan sat in the 11th car of a lightning train, hurtling toward Novar at 500 kilometers an hour—and the most consequential leader in the western world. Vambraces, greaves, and gloves of a dark, brushed metal were on his forearms, shins, and hands while his chest remained without armor. The near-black cloth covering the surface of his body was splashed with dark brown dirt and dust although his face was clean. A mask of the same near black cloth partially covered his face. No one knew his name… at least not yet.

“I said stop the train.” *There’s not time for this.* Alan didn’t believe in accidents anymore. He began striding toward the car’s attendant.

The train cabin was sleek, its dark blue seats a sharp contrast to the metallic body of the train. The rows of seats were firm yet surprisingly comfortable. Large windows lined the sides, offering a wide view of the outside world and the blur of the passing trees.

The attendant, wearing a dark blue uniform and jacket, sat at the front of the train car. Besides the name tag, the uniform and jacket were without adornment or even a second color to break the rich flow of dark blue other than a white symbol on his chest, the same symbol printed on every banner, engraved into the side of every car of the lightning train, and glowing from every magnetic binding, the device of Governor Marcus Kane. A curved saber hung from the attendant's side, its blade unembellished.

"Calm down, sir." The attendant replied. “What’s wrong?”

“There is a barricade on the tracks ahead undetectable to this train’s magnetic sensors and invisible to the human eye. What’s more, we have about four minutes till an impact that will undoubtedly kill everyone here." Alan spoke rapidly through his mask, each word precise.

“I’m sorry… could you say that again slower?”

Alan ground his teeth, took a deep breath, paused, and tried to speak slower. “There’s a barricade on the tracks ahead, undetectable by the train’s systems. We have about four minutes until impact.”

“Look, I’ve had enough chaos today with the attack at the station.”

Alan hated the way people used that word.*“Look, ….” just means “You’re the problem and I’m trying to be nice.”*

Alan said, “So you think because you’re done with chaos, chaos is done with you?”

“Look…”

*Stop saying that!* Alan thought.

“I can’t just believe a story about an imaginary, invisible, undetectable obstacle using magnetic resonance masking - a technology that literally doesn't exist.”

Alan took a deep breath. *This guy aught to be certificated as useless.* “Your reasoning is all wrong,” Alan said, gesturing with his hands to emphasize his logical sequence. “I’m telling you the barricade is there, which means the train’s monitors can’t detect it. So clearly, masking magnetic resonance not only exists but is approaching us at approximately 500 kilometers per hour.” *Three and a half minutes now.*

“Look, this train has a tight schedule.”

Alan restrained his impulse to punch the man’s face off.

The attendant continued, “The infiltrators who attacked the guards at the station may be crazy but they’re not stupid. Why would they try to stop a train before destroying it?”

“Look…” Alan mocked. “This conversation is over.” Alan took an aggressive step toward the attendant.

The attendant reached for his sword. “I don’t want to hurt you.”

“You know, I’ve would say I appreciate that sentiment, but I don’t.” 

Even though Alan was initiating the fight, he was at a disadvantage. He hadn’t even drawn a weapon. Only attendants were permitted to carry arms inside the train. Even if he somehow managed to rip the attendant’s sword from his grasp, it would immediately power down, its energy link keyed to the attendant’s handprint.

But before the attendant’s sword had completely cleared its sheath, Alan gripped the hilt with both hands, locking it in place.

The attendant reacted instantly, tightening his own grip and wrenching the weapon left and right in an attempt to break Alan’s hold, although the confined space made wide swings impossible.

Alan held on. But instead of ripping the sword out of the attendant’s hand, he began walking forward, pushing the attendant toward the front of the carriage.

The more the attendant struggled to free his sword, the more stationary it became… as if it had been divinely fixated to only move in one direction, forward. A flicker of confusion crossed his face, quickly replaced by something colder — realization. He was losing control.

Alan’s face would have been unreadable… even if the lower half hadn’t been concealed by a mask.

Fights were usually loud, chaotic affairs, but here, the only sounds were the attendant’s accelerated breathing, the muted buzz of the magnetic fields, and Alan’s measured footsteps—each one driving the attendant closer to the front wall of the carriage.





This is what Alan was waiting for. In a near reflexive move, he jammed the sword blade into the magnetic lock holding the right carriage door shut and stepped back.

The attendant yanked on the sword trying to pull the sword back out.

*120 seconds now.*

The buzzing intensified, rising to a sharp, piercing pitch as sparks crackled, growing louder with each burst.

Bam! The magnetic lock busted, shooting the sword across the carriage, the hilt making a dent in the over-engineered alloy that made up the body of the carriage.

Alan, using the attendant’s moment of slack jawed amazement, kicked him in the chest to get him away from the door. He wanted to kick him harder, but held back, only knocking him off his balance.

Alan braced himself beside the door. When he kicked the door open, the sudden rush would pull him out — and he’d be ready, gripping the edge of the train to keep from being thrown into the blur.

Alan kicked the door open, triggering a sudden pressure drop. The ears of every passenger popped in unison, including the attendant’s, who sat stunned and reeling.

Alan’s vambraces latched magnetically onto the side of the train and his greaves followed suit, positioning him parallel to the tracks.

Alan was no stranger to catastrophe, not in the world he’d grown up in. Though he was a stranger to being late. The most important man in this hemisphere wasn’t supposed to be in mortal danger. 

Yet here Alan was, clinging to the side of a speeding train, wind battering against him as he crawled his way toward the hardware panel at the back.

Alan received an alert on his monitor. What the attendant called “monitors” were state-of-the-art holographic overlays, projected directly into the user’s line of sight. In Alan’s case, the display hovered mere millimeters from his eyes. These holograms emitted no noticeable glow, blending information into his field of vision as if it were a natural part of his surroundings.


Alan looked up toward the front of the carriage just in time to see — through the side of the carriage — the attendant preparing to kick the door open himself.

*What is this? See one do one? Idiot.*

Alan scrambled on all fours horizontally along the side of the train, his boots, hands, and greaves all detaching and latching from the side of the train in perfect sync. Wall climbing doesn't reorient gravity. Although he was fixed to the side of the train, gravity still pulled him toward the ground which blurred past him.

Alan braced himself for the attendant’s imminent ejection into empty space. _Did getting shot out of a train going the speed of light seem attractive to you?_ he thought dryly.

The moment the attendant kicked the door open, the violent pressure change yanked him off his feet and threw him out. Alan caught him by the collar, and the wind flattened them both against the side of the train.

Alan looked at his monitor. A minute and fifteen seconds to decelerate. Thirty seconds till the governor’s drones get a visual.

He had to act now.

With quick, deft movements, Alan positioned himself perpendicular to the ground. He pulled a 45-centimeter cylindrical section of dark brushed metal from a small pack on his back. With swift precision, he hooked the attendant’s belt onto the rod and secured it to the side of the train. Alan needed both hands free to pry the door open against the force of the wind.

The entire time, the attendant had been no help at all, flailing in sheer panic. Alan reached for a second, identical rod from his pack but stopped. He glared back at the attendant.

“You got a death wish, or are you just stupid?”

The attendant quieted down.

Alan took the rod and latched it to the door, booting up its propulsion system with a precise sequence of taps in pentary—a base-5 coding system similar to binary. Each tap corresponded to a unique digit, though Alan had encrypted the sequence by scrambling the mappings to his fingers. Even if someone accessed the system, they’d only manage gibberish.

The faint yellow ring of the rod’s magnetic propulsion flared to life, its light rippling the air like heat above a fire. The force of the propulsion held the door firmly in place despite the howling wind outside.

Alan grabbed the attendant by the belt and hurled him through the doorway. If the man stayed outside, tethered or not, he’d never survive the ambush that was sure to come.

Without hesitation, Alan detached the rod from the door and aligned it with the other section already latched to the frame. With a sharp motion, he locked them together. At once, the faint yellow glow of the propulsion systems faded, and the two segments snapped seamlessly into place, forming half of a staff.

Alan looked to the crest of the hill. Kane’s drones would be in line of sight in seconds.  Although they operated autonomously, they were sure to relay all footage and data back to the governor. Instantly, Alan activated the hologram masking embedded in his mask. A faint shimmer rippled over his face, and his features transformed. His brown eyes shifted to a vivid blue, and his dark hair lightened to a pale blonde.

*No use disguising my whole body*, Alan thought, his fingers gripping the train’s edge as the wind howled past him. *I’m on the outside of a train, not taking a little stroll.*

If the drones scanned him, their visual processors would see someone entirely different—a critical misdirection when Kane’s forces inevitably reviewed the footage. Alan glanced at the monitor display flickering before his eyes.

*45 seconds.*

*Not enough time to “safely” crawl to the rear panel.* Alan’s options were dwindling fast. He could survive if he jumped before impact, but by then, it’d be too late for the boy gripping his father’s arm and the miserable, pathetic, trembling attendant on the floor.

Alan’s jaw tightened. *I’m not here to save myself.*

Time doesn’t move in slow motion; the speed of thought doesn’t change. Instead, Alan’s mind processed every detail—each of the 23 windows to the end of the carriage—before he let go. He prepared for the 315 milliseconds of free fall he’d have before catching the end of the carriage.

He let go.

His hands caught the corner of the carriage and slammed him into the back of the carriage. He recovered from the impact within moments. 

That’s one benefit of being 5 years old in a military “orphanage.” You learn to get back up quickly. Your life depended on it.
