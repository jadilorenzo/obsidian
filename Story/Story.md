## 0: Cras Mors Venit

Positioned fifty kilometers off the coast of California, THE NEMESIS — an anarchist vessel — silently completed its last system check of the ship’s most dangerous weapon, an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) with arrange of 100+ kilometers, surpassing the effective range of all EMPs before it.

Etched on the ship's side, just below its name, was the vessel's motto: "Cras Mors Venit," which translates to "Tomorrow we die.”

Anarchy wasn’t a revolution; it was a bomb.  The NEMESIS was the spark. 

EMPs have the capacity to violently overload circuitry by causing voltage spikes that fry both capacitors and the now unprotected components. Frying the central nervous system of the western hemisphere should do the trick.  

Near silent anticipation filled the air as the crew prepared to witness the initiation of that bomb anarchy. At precisely 9:59:59 AM, the EMP weapon unleashed its devastating power. 

But there had been a slight miscalculation. 

The engineers of this weapon hadn’t accounted for the pulse ricocheting off the  inside of the atmosphere which multiplied the force of the pulse seventeen times. Within 0.133 seconds, this wave of electromagnetic energy engulfed the entire surface of the globe.

As the invisible wave of the EMP raced across the globe, skylines instantly went dark and the world's technological infrastructure crumbled instantly. The dazzling screens that once commanded attention in every household turned into gaping black mirrors. Cars stalled on highways, their electronic brains fried. The crackle of electricity that had become the backdrop of modern life fell into an eerie silence — a silence soon filled with screams. It was anarchy.

## 1: Nothing is Fair in War

"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.”
— Sherlock Holmes


“Stop the train.” Alan said as he stood up.

The technological symphony had come to an abrupt end. But when it finally began again, it sung a harsher tune.

A century later, the world had changed. Contrary to visions of aliens, spaceships, and teleportation, the world was not so bizarre as it was dangerous. Alan wasn’t the only one wearing armor.

The days of unified nations were long gone, replaced by a patchwork of large city-states and powerful corporations that governed their territories. The strong ruled without mercy; the weak struggled without hope to survive under the shadow of war, execution, starvation, or assassination. Trust was rare and power was the ultimate currency.

However, an unexpected boon had emerged from the destruction of computer chips: new technology no longer relied on antiquated systems. Fiberglass microchips replaced their silicon predecessors, and copper wiring gave way to the blazing speed of fiberglass wire. Previous computers had been fast, but these new machines were limited only by the speed of light. Systems designed for the interception of intercontinental ballistic missiles could achieve their goal with relative ease. This boost to computing speed combined with discoveries in the arena of magnetic shields and blades reverted all combat to hand-to-hand. Depending on the size and variety, these shields could deflect full-blown tank shells, metal or otherwise. The edges, or more technically, destructive magnetic fields bound to blades, could tear through sheet metal. But when brought to bear in hand-to-hand combat, each blade counteracted the other. Fights like these were a matter of life or death.

And there were fights everywhere. Even in Novar, the capital of the most prosperous and peaceful region west of the war zone, the clustered streets had to be inundated with military-grade surveillance drones to keep the diverse visitors from murdering each other for their possessions or, worse, because of their precious political affiliations.

And during Novar’s annual festival, things reached a feverish mayhem. Foreigners and miscreants invaded the city.

But when the tournament started, everyone was there. The whole city poured its inhabitants and the mass of its security force into the Novar stadium — The Fate. ==WHAT IS THE STADIUM LIKE== The branding was intense: the words “The Fate” were inscribed over every arch and painted in giant red diagonal letters across every wall. For the contenders, it may well have read, “YOUR Fate.”

These weren’t slave fights or battles to the death; this event was decent — and strictly non-partisan. Though the policy of Marcus Kane forbade any political violence (murder most definitely included), few were secure against a political kamikaze assassin. Marcus Kane was one of those people.

Traffic into Novar leading up to the third and final day of The Fate’s tournament was intense. But, as the third day approached, a noticeable shift occurred. The frenetic pace of the city began to slow, though the lightning trains from their different origins never paused. They never stopped — bar bombing.

So there Alan was… in a lightning train in the 11th car, cruising at 310 miles an hour. Vambraces, greaves, and gloves of a dark, brushed metal were on his forearms, shins, and hands while his chest remained without armor. The near-black cloth covering the surface of his body was splashed with dark brown giving him a dirty appearance. A mask of the same near black cloth partially covered his face. No one knew his name… at least not yet.

“I said stop the train.” *There’s not much time for this.* Alan began striding toward the car’s attendant.

The attendant, wearing a dark blue uniform and jacket, sat at the front of the train car. Besides the name tag, the uniform and jacket were without adornment or even a second color to break the rich flow of dark blue other than a white symbol on his chest, the same symbol printed on every banner, engraved into the side of every car of the lightning train, and glowing from every magnetic binding, the device of Marcus Kane. A curved saber hung from the attendant's side, its blade unembellished.

"What is it?" The attendant replied quickly.

“There is a barricade on the tracks undetectable to this train’s magnetic visualizers and invisible to the human eye, closing in at the speed of 500 kilometers an hour. We have about four minutes till impact." Although Alan’s language was precise, he spoke through his mask at a blistering pace with perfect clarity.

“Then, why can’t the conductor see it on the monitors?” the attendant said.

Alan sighed, resisting the urge to clench his fists and jaw. “That’s what un-de-tect-a-ble means.”

“But if the monitors don’t say it’s there, then it’s not there… No system can mask the magnetic resonance of physical objects.”

“Your reasoning is all wrong: I said the barricade is there. That means this train’s monitors can’t see it. Subsequently, magnetic resonance masking exists.” *Three and a half minutes now.*

“Look, I couldn’t help you even if I wanted to.”

Alan hated the way people used that condescending “Look, …” It was straight code for “You’re the problem and I’m trying to be nice.”

“That’s demonstrably false. Why else do you have an emergency brake in that compartment?” Alan said getting in the attendants face and pointing to a small compartment beside the attendant’s seat which was positioned opposite the carriage’s door.

“Michael, I’ve already tried to warn the conductor. We approximately two and a half minutes to begin deceleration.”

“How do you know my name?”

Alan restrained his impulse to punch the man’s face off.  “Your name tag.”

The attendant struggled through the confusion typical of the response to Alan pointing out the obvious.

*I don’t have time for this.*

Alan brought his open hands into a fighting stance, activating his gloves which began to glow a faint yellow with the light of their electromagnetic field set for deflect and stun.

The attendant reached for his sword.

The other passengers backed into their seats to avoid being hit by a stray blade. They weren’t particularly afraid… if the conductor couldn’t detect it, the obstacle didn’t exist. As for Alan, he didn’t stand a chance. All Kane’s soldiers were trained hardcore. Besides, the attendant was taller and appeared more muscular.

Alan stepped forward and the attendant launched his sword out of its sheath swinging it in a wide diagonal arc that was sure to cut Alan’s torso open.  

But Alan was long gone before the sword cut through the empty space before him. In a fraction of a second, Alan grabbed the attendant’s sword hilt as it began to swing the opposite direction, using his other hand to grab the base of the blade just above the handle. 

Had Alan grabbed the blade without his protected gloves, his fingers would have been severed from his hand on contact.

The attendant, now gripping the sword with two hands, swung the sword left and right with incredible violence.

Alan held on. But instead of ripping the sword out of the attendant’s hand, he began walking forward, pushing the attendant toward the front of the carriage.  

The more the attendant struggled to free his sword, the more stationary it became as if it had been divinely fixated to only move in one direction, forward. Alan’s eyes met the attendant’s with a cold calibration. His face would have been unreadable even if the lower half hadn’t been concealed.

Usually fights are accompanied by an excess of movement and sound, but the only thing to hear was the attendant’s accelerated breathing, the muted buzzing of the magnetic fields, and Alan’s measured footsteps, moving the attendant closer and closer to the front wall of the carriage. 

After a few seconds of intense struggle, the attendant had an idea. 

It couldn’t be called a stroke of genius. Alan had considered and accounted for that same revelation before he even left his seat.

Because the fields protecting Alan’s hands operated at a lower energy level to maintain flexibility, any higher-energy field could destabilize their shields, possibly breaking through and delivering a dangerous electric shock.

The attendant simply needed to increase the power to his sword. With a swift motion, he slid the input control on his hilt from 7 to 10 Tesla (a unit of magnetic density).

This is what Alan was waiting for. In a near reflexive move, he jammed the sword blade into the magnetic lock holding the right carriage door shut and stepped back.  

The attendant yanked on the sword trying to pull the sword back out.

*120 seconds now.*

The buzzing intensified, rising to a sharp, piercing pitch as sparks crackled, growing louder with each burst.

Bam! The magnetic lock busted, shooting the sword across the carriage, the hilt making a dent in the over-engineered alloy that made up the body of the carriage.

Alan, using the attendant’s moment of slack jawed amazement, kicked him in the chest to get him away from the door. He wanted to kick him harder, but held back, only knocking him off his balance. 

Alan positioned himself beside the door, bracing his hands against the right panel. When he kicked the door open, the sudden rush would pull him out — and he’d be ready, gripping the edge of the train to keep from being thrown into the blur.

Alan kicked the door open, triggering a sudden pressure drop. The ears of every passenger popped in unison, including the attendant’s, who sat stunned, reeling from the sudden assault on his senses.









# Other
    One lightning train sped on toward Novar, its few passengers a particularly no-nonsense, practical lot. There were merchants and salesmen looking to sell their products to the festival attendees. There were a variety of sketchy characters, including a rather serious man wearing a dirty brown cloak and a boy of about 15 years old who had heard (although a little later than his compatriots) that Novar was the place to be. A mother and her 10-year-old son completed the eclectic mix.
An attendant in a dark blue uniform and jacket traversed the train’s passage, diligently ensuring  everyone was seated. The uniform and jacket were without adornment — or even a second color to break the rich flow of dark blue other than a white symbol on his chest, the same symbol printed on every banner, engraved into the side of every car of the lightning train, and glowing from every magnetic binding. The symbol was a [blank], the insignia of Novar's governor, Marcus Kane. A curved saber hung from the attendant's side, its blade unembellished.







The man whom the attendant had addressed was a boy, 16 years old. Strapped to his waist was a bare-bladed curved saber, an ornament worn by every passenger and attendant in some form or other. There were the standard straight short swords worn by the attendants. Then there were the plethora of other shapes and sizes: small axes, large axes, double swords, knives, and even the occasional hammer.

The boy answered the attendant with a "Uh, yeah." and adjusted himself into his seat.

A few rows behind him, 











As Alan walked, the state of the world was often on his mind.

Far before the merchant had spoken, Alan had taken stock of every weapon on the hillside, instinctively assessing all potential threats or weaknesses, from the merchant’s short sword to the concealed knife on a relatively elderly man fifty yards distant. It was a habit ingrained in him from a lifetime of guarding the defenseless and stepping in when the odds seemed insurmountable.

Alan was born an orphan in a violent world, and he looked the part. Alan was of an agile build. He wore tight-fitting, flexible brown fabric blending into black, accompanied by dark metal armor adorning his shins and forearms to preserve the utmost flexibility and agility. He was covered in dirt and grime from his cloak to his boots.

Alan was a master of combat _and_ technology. A tall staff of dark seamless metal rested, magnetically suspended on his back, ready to be drawn at a moment's notice. It was more than a quarterstaff of medieval times.

An unexpected boon had emerged from the destruction of computer chips: new technology no longer relied on antiquated systems. Fiberglass microchips replaced their silicon predecessors, and copper wiring gave way to the blazing speed of fiberglass wire. Previous computers had been fast, but these new machines were limited only by the speed of light. Systems initially designed for the interception of intercontinental ballistic missiles could achieve their goal with relative ease. This boost to computing speed combined with discoveries in the arena of magnetic shields and blades. Depending on the size and variety, these shields could deflect up to full-blown tank shells, metal or not. The edges, or more technically destructive magnetic fields, could easily tear through sheet metal. However, when brought to bear in hand-to-hand combat, each blade counteracted the other.

Alan utilized these technologies as the primary mechanism in his staff in addition to a plethora of customizations. A low-profile, personal hologram overlay computer rested over his left year, providing additional information to his eyes. Nor was Alan the only one carrying a weapon on the path to Novar.

Novar stood, a formidable fortress, its grandeur evident in every aspect. A massive wall encircled the city, serving as a conspicuous defense against potential invaders. However, since the beginning of the Novar festival, the protective shield enveloping Novar's airspace, typically inconspicuous, brilliantly filled the sky. Multitudes of military-grade surveillance drones monitored the city, and every last one was necessary.

Their purpose was twofold. The first was to spy on any new technology that entered the city. Governor Marcus Kane knew that information is power, and was willing to play that card for all it was worth. The second was to prevent crime among the hoards of newcomers more often than not armed to the teeth.

The Novar festival was centered on its famous tournament. Hundreds of worthy competitors came to participate. Thousands of substantially less worthy miscreants flooded the city in search of prey. Though the Novar security force could arrive on the scene within the minute, they had not mastered the ancient arts of Sherlock Holmes. Thus, most crimes had become hit-and-run ordeals.

If one had temporary omniscience, one would have noticed two things happen simultaneously on that forest trail. First, Alan, whose conversation had ended in silence a minute before, focused his eyes on the distance and silently vanished into the crowd. Second, fifty yards ahead, a man in a flamboyant blue and gold cape, not unusual garb for a tournament participant, drew a hand-held taser from his pocket which he concealed in his palm.

Several paces ahead an elderly but vivacious man of about seventy years of age tottered along surrounded by a swarm of various matching attendants and aids wearing white and baby-blue. The man in the gold and blue cape saw his opportunity.

With measured steps, he approached the elderly man, a smile curving his lips as he offered a veneer of polite service. His voice was honeyed. “My dear sir…”

The old man's gaze met his, and for an instant, time seemed to pause as the old man looked up in gentle expectation. In the next breath, the man collapsed, his descent to the ground eerily silent, leaving all but one of his attendants frozen in shock.

Almost as soon as the old man’s unconscious body hit the ground, one seemingly unassuming attendant sprang into action. Nothing about this man's appearance would have suggested action. If one had to describe the smooth face and intelligent eyes behind his round glasses, one would have thought he had never seen the world outside his mind.

He lunged forward with a remarkable burst of swiftness, intercepting the concealed knife mid-air as it ricocheted off the ground. The weapon had slipped from the old man's coat amidst the chaos.

Without hesitation, the attendant in white rushed toward the cape-wearing man. The latter discarded the miniature taser in favor of a drawn sword, the single edge glowed a faint blue in the dappled sunlight.

But the man in the blue cape was prepared for such situations. With a swift motion, he stood and drew a sword from a hidden sheath.

However, the sound of steel on steel was inconsistent. In addition to the irregular sound of a sword versus knife, the blades often wouldn’t even meet, the magnetic fields stopping the blades only millimeters away.

The struggle between the two men was intense, drawing the attention of the onlookers. The hubbub of conversation turned into gasps and murmurs as the scene unfolded. The forest path became a battleground of its own, the skirmish contrasting starkly with the peaceful surroundings.

Amidst the chaos, a shriveled man, barely noticeable in the crowd, crawled through the throng of spectators. His gnarled fingers reached out, his eyes fixed on a small, square-inch-sized jewel hanging from the old man's belt. The credit token,



This was the main lines to Novar. The city braced itself for the annual Novar festival. Weapons, more than usual, adorned the belts of the festival attendees, a stark reminder of the city's heightened state of vigilance.

Novar, a formidable fortress in its own right, stood proudly, its grandeur evident in every aspect. Encircled by a massive wall, the city boasted an unmistakable defense against potential invaders. However, during the festival, an additional layer of protection enveloped Novar's airspace, the shimmering shield casting a radiant glow across the sky. Countless military-grade surveillance drones hovered above, their watchful eyes scanning the cityscape, ever vigilant.

These drones served a dual purpose. Firstly, they monitored any new technology entering the city, ensuring that Governor Marcus Kane remained informed and in control. Secondly, they acted as a deterrent against crime, their presence serving as a stark warning to would-be wrongdoers.

Central to the Novar festival was its famed tournament, drawing hundreds of skilled competitors from far and wide. Yet, amidst the excitement of the event, Novar found itself inundated with a less savory crowd — opportunistic miscreants seeking easy prey among the festival-goers. Though the Novar security force prided itself on its swift response time, the city's labyrinthine streets often allowed criminals to vanish into the shadows before justice could be served.

**

Life was dangerous. Despite the presence of police drones patrolling both countryside and urban areas, the likelihood of meeting a violent end was substantial. Surviving to forty years old required not just skill, but a significant stroke of luck.

It's like a bubble

error binary 

With the abrupt cessation of the technological symphony that had been the modern world, the landscape transformed. Once-proud skyscrapers, monuments to human achievement, now stood as silent skeletons of progress.



The attendant drew his sword saying "Stay back, or I'll have no choice."

Alan drew no weapon but continued his confident stride.

As Alan drew near, the attendant's uniform transformed into geometrical armor. It was an artistic hologram of course, and any magnetic scan would have revealed the true surface of the attendant's chest. Individual multi-mode scanning units (thermal vision, magnetic vision, sonar vision) were ubiquitous.
