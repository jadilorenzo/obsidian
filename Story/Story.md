## 0: Cras Mors Venit

Positioned fifty kilometers off the coast of California, THE NEMESIS — an anarchist vessel — silently completed its last system check of the ship’s most dangerous weapon, an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) with a range of over 100 kilometers, surpassing any before it.

Etched on the ship's side, just below its name, was the vessel's motto: "Cras Mors Venit," which translates to "Tomorrow we die.”

Anarchy wasn’t a revolution; it was a bomb. The NEMESIS was the spark.

EMPs have the capacity to violently overload circuitry by causing voltage spikes that fry both capacitors and the now unprotected components. Frying the central nervous system of the western hemisphere should do the trick.

Near silent anticipation filled the air as the crew prepared to witness the initiation of that bomb anarchy. At precisely 9:59:59 AM, the EMP weapon unleashed its devastating power.

But there had been a slight miscalculation.

The engineers of this weapon hadn’t accounted for the pulse ricocheting off the inside of the atmosphere which multiplied the force of the pulse seventeen times. Within 0.133 seconds, this wave of electromagnetic energy engulfed the entire surface of the globe.

As the invisible wave of the EMP raced across the globe, skylines instantly went dark and the world's technological infrastructure crumbled instantly. The dazzling screens that once commanded attention in every household turned into gaping black mirrors. Cars stalled on highways, their electronic brains fried. The crackle of electricity that had become the backdrop of modern life fell into an eerie silence — a silence soon filled with screams. It was anarchy.

## 1: Nothing is Fair in War

"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.”
— Sherlock Holmes

“Stop the train.” Alan said as he stood up.

The technological symphony had come to an abrupt end. But when it finally began again, it sung a harsher tune.

A century later, the world had changed. Contrary to visions of aliens, spaceships, and teleportation, the world was not so bizarre as it was dangerous. Alan wasn’t the only one wearing armor.

The days of unified nations were long gone, replaced by a patchwork of large city-states and powerful corporations that governed their territories. The strong ruled without mercy; the weak struggled without hope to survive under the shadow of war, execution, starvation, or assassination. Trust was rare and power was the ultimate currency.

However, an unexpected boon had emerged from the destruction of computer chips: new technology no longer relied on antiquated systems. Fiberglass microchips replaced their silicon predecessors, and copper wiring gave way to the blazing speed of fiberglass wire. Previous computers had been fast, but these new machines were limited only by the speed of light. Systems designed for the interception of intercontinental ballistic missiles could achieve their goal with relative ease. This boost to computing speed combined with discoveries in the arena of magnetic shields and blades reverted all combat to hand-to-hand. Depending on the size and variety, these shields could deflect full-blown tank shells, metal or otherwise. The edges, or more technically, destructive magnetic fields bound to blades, could tear through sheet metal. But when brought to bear in hand-to-hand combat, each blade counteracted the other. Fights like these were a matter of life or death.

And there were fights everywhere. Even in Novar, the capital of the most prosperous and peaceful region west of the war zone, the clustered streets had to be inundated with military-grade surveillance drones to keep the diverse visitors from murdering each other for their possessions or, worse, because of their precious political affiliations.

And during Novar’s annual festival, things reached a feverish mayhem. Foreigners and miscreants invaded the city.

But when the tournament started, everyone was there. The whole city poured its inhabitants and the mass of its security force into the Novar stadium — The Fate. ==WHAT IS THE STADIUM LIKE== The branding was intense: the words “The Fate” were inscribed over every arch and painted in giant red diagonal letters across every wall. For the contenders, it may well have read, “YOUR Fate.”

These weren’t slave fights or battles to the death; this event was decent — and strictly non-partisan. Though the policy of Marcus Kane forbade any political violence (murder most definitely included), few were secure against a political kamikaze assassin. Marcus Kane was one of those people.

Traffic into Novar leading up to the third and final day of The Fate’s tournament was intense. But, as the third day approached, a noticeable shift occurred. The frenetic pace of the city began to slow, though the lightning trains from their different origins never paused. They never stopped — bar bombing.

So there Alan was… in a lightning train in the 11th car, cruising at 310 miles an hour. Vambraces, greaves, and gloves of a dark, brushed metal were on his forearms, shins, and hands while his chest remained without armor. The near-black cloth covering the surface of his body was splashed with dark brown giving him a dirty appearance. A mask of the same near black cloth partially covered his face. No one knew his name… at least not yet.

“I said stop the train.” _There’s not much time for this._ Alan began striding toward the car’s attendant.

The attendant, wearing a dark blue uniform and jacket, sat at the front of the train car. Besides the name tag, the uniform and jacket were without adornment or even a second color to break the rich flow of dark blue other than a white symbol on his chest, the same symbol printed on every banner, engraved into the side of every car of the lightning train, and glowing from every magnetic binding, the device of Marcus Kane. A curved saber hung from the attendant's side, its blade unembellished.

"What is it?" The attendant replied quickly.

“There is a barricade on the tracks undetectable to this train’s magnetic visualizers and invisible to the human eye, closing in at the speed of 500 kilometers an hour. We have about four minutes till impact." Although Alan’s language was precise, he spoke through his mask at a blistering pace with perfect clarity.

“Then, why can’t the conductor see it on the monitors?” the attendant said.

Alan sighed, resisting the urge to clench his fists and jaw. “That’s what un-de-tect-a-ble means.”

“But if the monitors don’t say it’s there, then it’s not there… No system can mask the magnetic resonance of physical objects.”

“Your reasoning is all wrong: I said the barricade is there. That means this train’s monitors can’t see it. Subsequently, magnetic resonance masking exists.” _Three and a half minutes now._

“Look, I couldn’t help you even if I wanted to.”

Alan hated the way people used that condescending “Look, …” It was straight code for “You’re the problem and I’m trying to be nice.”

“That’s demonstrably false. Why else do you have an emergency brake in that compartment?” Alan said getting in the attendants face and pointing to a small compartment beside the attendant’s seat which was positioned opposite the carriage’s door.

“Michael, I’ve already tried to warn the conductor. We approximately two and a half minutes to begin deceleration.”

“How do you know my name?”

Alan restrained his impulse to punch the man’s face off. “Your name tag.”

The attendant struggled through the confusion typical of the response to Alan pointing out the obvious.

_I don’t have time for this._

Alan brought his open hands into a fighting stance, activating his gloves which began to glow a faint yellow with the light of their electromagnetic field set for deflect and stun.

The attendant reached for his sword.

The other passengers backed into their seats to avoid being hit by a stray blade. They weren’t particularly afraid… if the conductor couldn’t detect it, the obstacle didn’t exist. As for Alan, he didn’t stand a chance. All Kane’s soldiers were trained hardcore. Besides, the attendant was taller and appeared more muscular.

Alan stepped forward and the attendant launched his sword out of its sheath swinging it in a wide diagonal arc that was sure to cut Alan’s torso open.

But Alan was long gone before the sword cut through the empty space before him. In a fraction of a second, Alan grabbed the attendant’s sword hilt as it began to swing the opposite direction, using his other hand to grab the base of the blade just above the handle.

Had Alan grabbed the blade without his protected gloves, his fingers would have been severed from his hand on contact.

The attendant, now gripping the sword with two hands, swung the sword left and right with incredible violence.

Alan held on. But instead of ripping the sword out of the attendant’s hand, he began walking forward, pushing the attendant toward the front of the carriage.

The more the attendant struggled to free his sword, the more stationary it became as if it had been divinely fixated to only move in one direction, forward. Alan’s eyes met the attendant’s with a cold calibration. His face would have been unreadable even if the lower half hadn’t been concealed.

Usually fights are accompanied by an excess of movement and sound, but the only thing to hear was the attendant’s accelerated breathing, the muted buzzing of the magnetic fields, and Alan’s measured footsteps, moving the attendant closer and closer to the front wall of the carriage.

After a few seconds of intense struggle, the attendant had an idea.

It couldn’t be called a stroke of genius. Alan had considered and accounted for that same revelation before he even left his seat.

Because the fields protecting Alan’s hands operated at a lower energy level to maintain flexibility, any higher-energy field could destabilize their shields, possibly breaking through and delivering a dangerous electric shock.

The attendant simply needed to increase the power to his sword. With a swift motion, he slid the input control on his hilt from 7 to 10 Tesla (a unit of magnetic density).

This is what Alan was waiting for. In a near reflexive move, he jammed the sword blade into the magnetic lock holding the right carriage door shut and stepped back.

The attendant yanked on the sword trying to pull the sword back out.

_120 seconds now._

The buzzing intensified, rising to a sharp, piercing pitch as sparks crackled, growing louder with each burst.

Bam! The magnetic lock busted, shooting the sword across the carriage, the hilt making a dent in the over-engineered alloy that made up the body of the carriage.

Alan, using the attendant’s moment of slack jawed amazement, kicked him in the chest to get him away from the door. He wanted to kick him harder, but held back, only knocking him off his balance.

Alan positioned himself beside the door, bracing his hands against the right panel. When he kicked the door open, the sudden rush would pull him out — and he’d be ready, gripping the edge of the train to keep from being thrown into the blur.

Alan kicked the door open, triggering a sudden pressure drop. The ears of every passenger popped in unison, including the attendant’s, who sat stunned, reeling.

Alan’s vambraces latched onto the side of the train and his greaves followed suit, positioning him parallel to the tracks.

*Ok so I have 90 seconds to get to the back of the carriage to *
