## 0: Cras Mors Venit

Positioned fifty kilometers off the coast of California, THE NEMESIS — an anarchist vessel — silently completed its last system check of the ship’s most dangerous weapon, an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) with a range of over 100 kilometers, surpassing any before it.

Etched on the ship's side, just below its name, was the vessel's motto: "Cras Mors Venit," which translates to "Tomorrow we die.”

Anarchy wasn’t a revolution; it was a bomb. The NEMESIS was the spark.

EMPs have the capacity to violently overload circuitry by causing voltage spikes that fry both capacitors and the now unprotected components. Frying the central nervous system of the western hemisphere was calculated to start WWIII.

Near silent anticipation filled the air as the crew prepared to witness the DETONATION. At precisely 9:59:59 AM, the EMP weapon unleashed its devastating power.

But there had been a slight miscalculation.

The engineers of this weapon hadn’t accounted for the pulse ricocheting off the inside of the atmosphere which multiplied the force of the pulse over seventeen times. Within 0.133 seconds, this wave of electromagnetic energy engulfed the surface of the globe.

As the invisible wave of the EMP raced across the globe, skylines instantly went dark and the world's technological infrastructure crumbled. Instantly. The dazzling screens that once commanded attention in every household became lifeless, gaping black mirrors. Cars stalled on highways, their electronic brains fried. The crackle of electricity that had become the backdrop of modern life fell into an eerie moment of silence — a silence soon filled with screams.

## 1: Nothing is Fair in War

"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.”
— Sherlock Holmes

“Stop the train.” Alan said as he stood up.

The world’s technological symphony had come to a screeching halt. When it began again, it sung a harsher tune.

A century later, the world was more dangerous than fantastical — no aliens, no spaceships, no teleportation. Alan wasn’t the only one wearing armor.

The days of unified nations were long gone, replaced by a patchwork of large city-states and powerful corporations that governed their territories. The strong ruled without mercy; the weak struggled without hope —hope to survive under the shadow of war, execution, starvation, or assassination. Trust was rare.

However, an unexpected benefit had emerged from the destruction of computer chips: new technology no longer relied on antiquated systems. Fiberglass microchips replaced their silicon predecessors, and copper wiring gave way to the blazing speed of fiberglass wire. Previous computers had been fast, but these new machines were only limited by the speed of light. Systems designed for the interception of intercontinental ballistic missiles could achieve their goal with relative ease. This boost to computing speed, combined with discoveries in the arenas of magnetic deflection and magnetic blade technology, reverted all combat to hand-to-hand. Bullets were useless. Depending on the size and variety, these shields could deflect full-blown tank shells, metal or otherwise. The magnetic blade edges could tear through sheet metal. But when brought to bear in hand-to-hand combat, each blade counteracted the other. Decapitation was as effortless as a single, well-placed stroke of a blade.

 Fights like this were everywhere. Even in Novar, the capital of the most prosperous and peaceful region west of the war zone, the clustered streets had to be inundated with military-grade surveillance drones to keep the diverse visitors from murdering each other.

During Novar’s annual festival, things reached a feverish mayhem. Foreigners and miscreants invaded the city.

When the tournament started, everyone was there. The whole city poured its inhabitants and the mass of its security force into the Novar stadium — The Fate. It was massive, taking up tens of thousands of square meters. The branding was intense: the words “The Fate” were inscribed over every arch and painted in giant red diagonal letters across every wall. For the contenders, it may well have read, “YOUR Fate.”

These weren’t slave fights or battles to the death; this event was decent. Contestants entered willingly, drawn by Governor Marcus Kane’s generous rewards and a chance at fame.

What’s more, this event was fair. Beyond the stringent rules and regulations, Governor Kane 

Governor Marcus Kane ensured a level playing field by providing high-grade armor, even to those who lacked it, that neutralized the deadly edges of magnetic blades by converting their energy into concussive electrocution. Weapons, however, were not supplied—contestants had to bring their own, whether it was a sword, quarterstaff, or mace.

Traffic into Novar leading up to the third and final day of The Fate’s tournament was intense. But, as the third day approached, a noticeable shift occurred. The frenetic pace of the city began to slow, though the lightning hover trains from their different origins never paused. They never stopped — bar bombing.

So there Alan was… in a lightning train in the 11th car, cruising at  500 kilometers an hour. Vambraces, greaves, and gloves of a dark, brushed metal were on his forearms, shins, and hands while his chest remained without armor. The near-black cloth covering the surface of his body was splashed with dark brown giving him a dirty appearance. A mask of the same near black cloth partially covered his face. No one knew his name… at least not yet.

“I said stop the train.” *There’s not time for this. The attack at the station and now this?* Alan didn’t believe in accidents anymore. He began striding toward the car’s attendant.

The attendant, wearing a dark blue uniform and jacket, sat at the front of the train car. Besides the name tag, the uniform and jacket were without adornment or even a second color to break the rich flow of dark blue other than a white symbol on his chest, the same symbol printed on every banner, engraved into the side of every car of the lightning train, and glowing from every magnetic binding, the device of Governor Marcus Kane. A curved saber hung from the attendant's side, its blade unembellished.

"What is it?" The attendant replied.

“There is a barricade on the tracks undetectable to this train’s magnetic visualizers and invisible to the human eye, getting closer at the speed of 500 kilometers an hour. We have about four minutes till impact." Alan spoke rapidly through his mask, each word precise.

“Then, why can’t the conductor see it on the monitors?” the attendant said.

Alan sighed, resisting the urge to clench his fists and jaw. “That’s what un-de-tect-a-ble means.” *Incompetent.*

“But if the monitors don’t say it’s there, then it’s not there… No system can mask the magnetic resonance of physical objects.”

“Your reasoning is all wrong,” Alan said, gesturing with his hands to emphasize his train of thought. “I’m telling you the barricade is there, which means the train’s monitors can’t detect it. So clearly, masking magnetic resonance is possible.”*Three and a half minutes now.*

“Look, I couldn’t help you even if I wanted to.”

Alan hated the way people used that condescending “Look, …” It was straight code for “You’re the problem and I’m trying to be nice.”

“That’s demonstrably false. Why else do you have a console with access to an emergency brake in that compartment?” Alan said, getting in the attendant's face and pointing to a small compartment beside the attendant’s seat which was positioned opposite the carriage’s door. *There’s no way I can hack that in time.*

“Michael,” Alan said, “I’ve already tried to warn the conductor. We are approximately two and a half minutes to begin deceleration.”

“How do you know my name?”

Alan restrained his impulse to punch the man’s face off. “Your name tag.” 

The attendant struggled through the confusion typical of the response to Alan pointing out the obvious.

*I don’t have time for this if I intend to keep everyone’s spine intact.*

Alan brought his open hands into a fighting stance, activating his gloves which began to glow a faint yellow with the light of their electromagnetic field set for deflect and stun. His jaw was set. *I’m not messing up.*

The attendant reached for his sword.

The other passengers backed into their seats to avoid being hit by a stray blade. They weren’t particularly afraid… if the conductor couldn’t detect it, the obstacle didn’t exist. As for Alan, he didn’t stand a chance. All Kane’s soldiers were trained hardcore. Besides, the attendant was bigger than Alan.

Alan stepped forward and the attendant launched his sword out of its sheath swinging it in a wide diagonal arc that was sure to cut Alan’s torso open.

But Alan was long gone before the sword cut through the empty space before him. In a fraction of a second, Alan grabbed the attendant’s sword hilt as it began to swing the opposite direction, using his other hand to grab the base of the blade just above the handle.

Had Alan grabbed the blade without his protected gloves, his fingers would have been severed from his hand on contact.

Gripping the sword with both hands, the attendant swung it violently left and right.

Alan held on. But instead of ripping the sword out of the attendant’s hand, he began walking forward, pushing the attendant toward the front of the carriage.

The more the attendant struggled to free his sword, the more stationary it became as if it had been divinely fixated to only move in one direction, forward. Alan’s eyes met the attendant’s with a cold calibration. His face would have been unreadable even if the lower half hadn’t been concealed by a mask.

Usually fights are accompanied by an excess of movement and sound, but the only thing to hear was the attendant’s accelerated breathing, the muted buzzing of the magnetic fields, and Alan’s measured footsteps, moving the attendant closer and closer to the front wall of the carriage.

After a few seconds of intense struggle, the attendant had an idea.

It couldn’t be called a stroke of genius. Alan had considered and accounted for that same revelation before he even left his seat.

Because the fields protecting Alan’s hands operated at a lower energy level to maintain flexibility, any higher-energy field could destabilize their shields, possibly breaking through and delivering a dangerous electric shock.

The attendant simply needed to increase the power to his sword. With a swift motion, he slid the input control on his hilt from 7 to 10 Tesla (a unit of magnetic density).

This is what Alan was waiting for. In a near reflexive move, he jammed the sword blade into the magnetic lock holding the right carriage door shut and stepped back.

The attendant yanked on the sword trying to pull the sword back out.

*120 seconds now.*

The buzzing intensified, rising to a sharp, piercing pitch as sparks crackled, growing louder with each burst.

Bam! The magnetic lock busted, shooting the sword across the carriage, the hilt making a dent in the over-engineered alloy that made up the body of the carriage.

Alan, using the attendant’s moment of slack jawed amazement, kicked him in the chest to get him away from the door. He wanted to kick him harder, but held back, only knocking him off his balance.

Alan braced himself beside the door. When he kicked the door open, the sudden rush would pull him out — and he’d be ready, gripping the edge of the train to keep from being thrown into the blur.

Alan kicked the door open, triggering a sudden pressure drop. The ears of every passenger popped in unison, including the attendant’s, who sat stunned, reeling.

Alan’s vambraces latched onto the side of the train and his greaves followed suit, positioning him parallel to the tracks.

Alan was no stranger to catastrophe, not in the world he’d grown up in. But typically, he wasn’t running late. The most important man in this hemisphere wasn’t supposed to be in mortal danger. Yet here Alan was, clinging to the side of a speeding train, wind battering against him as he crawled his way toward the hardware panel at the back.

Alan received an alert on his monitor. What the attendant called “monitors” were actually state-of-the-art holographic overlays, projected directly into the user’s line of sight. In Alan’s case, the display hovered mere millimeters from his eyes. These passive holograms emitted no noticeable glow, blending seamlessly into his vision and presenting information as if it were a natural part of his surroundings.

Alan looked up toward the front of the carriage just in time to see — through the side of the carriage — the attendant preparing to kick the door open himself.

*What is this? See one do one? Idiot.*

Alan scrambled on all fours horizontally along the side of the train, his boots, hands, and greaves all detaching and latching from the side of the train in perfect sync. Wall climbing doesn't reorient gravity. Although he was fixed to the side of the train, gravity still pulled him toward the ground which blurred past him.

Alan braced himself for the attendant’s imminent ejection into empty space. _Did getting shot out of a train going the speed of light seem attractive to you?_ he thought dryly.

The moment the attendant kicked the door open, the violent pressure change yanked him off his feet and threw him out. Alan caught him by the collar, the wind flattening them both against the side of the train.

Alan looked at his monitor. A minute and fifteen seconds to decelerate. Thirty seconds till the governor’s drones get a visual.

He had to act now.

With quick, deft movements, Alan positioned himself perpendicular to the ground. He pulled a 45-centimeter cylindrical section of dark brushed metal from a small pack on his back. With swift precision, he hooked the attendant’s belt onto the rod and secured it to the side of the train. Alan needed both hands free to pry the door open.

The entire time, the attendant had been no help at all, flailing in sheer panic. Alan reached for a second, identical rod from his pack but stopped. He glared back at the attendant.

“You got a death wish, or are you just an idiot?”

The attendant quieted down.

Alan took the rod and latched it to the door, booting up its propulsion system with a precise sequence of taps in pentary—a base-5 coding system similar to binary. Each tap corresponded to a unique digit, but Alan had encrypted the sequence by scrambling the mappings to his fingers. Even if someone accessed the system, they’d only manage gibberish.

The faint yellow ring of the rod’s magnetic propulsion flared to life, its light rippling the air like heat above a fire. The force held the door firmly in place despite the howling wind outside.

Alan grabbed the attendant by the belt and hurled him through the doorway. If the man stayed outside, tethered or not, he’d never survive the ambush. 

Without hesitation, Alan detached the rod from the door and aligned it with the other section already latched to the frame. With a sharp motion, he locked them together. At once, the faint yellow glow of the propulsion systems faded, and the two segments snapped seamlessly into place, forming half of a staff.

Alan looked to the crest of the hill. Kane’s drones would be in line of sight in seconds. Instantly, Alan activated the hologram masking embedded in his mask. A faint shimmer rippled over his face, and his features transformed. His brown eyes shifted to a vivid blue, and his dark hair lightened to a pale blonde.

*No use disguising my whole body*, Alan thought, his fingers gripping the train’s edge as the wind howled past him. *I’m on the outside of a train, not giving a public speech.*

Even if the drones scanned him, their visual processors would see someone entirely different—a critical misdirection when Kane’s forces inevitably reviewed the footage. Alan glanced at the monitor display flickering before his eyes.

*45 seconds.*

*Not enough time to crawl to the rear panel.* His options were dwindling fast. He could survive if he jumped before impact, but by then, it’d be too late for the boy gripping his father’s arm and the miserable, pathetic, trembling attendant on the floor.

Alan’s jaw tightened. *I’m not here to save myself.* 

The popular imagery of time moving in slow motion is misleading. It’s not that the world slows down, but rather that the mind predicts reality with razor-sharp precision before it unfolds. Alan didn’t see events as they were — he saw them as they would be. 

Without him, they would have been speeding to their deaths. Progress!
