Jacob: Falstaff
Renee: Prince
Angelina: Poins



[Enter PRINCE and POINS on webcam]

Poins: *(As if he just stopped laughing)* Come: I have removed Falstaff's
horse, and he frets like a scholar betwixt his freedom and his finals. 

Prince: *(under his breath)* A situation I am well acquainted with... Here he comes.

[Exit POINS and enter FALSTAFF]

Falstaff: Poins! Poins! Come and be hanged! Poins!          745

Prince: Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost
thou keep!

Falstaff: Where's Poins, Hal? *(as in distress)*

Prince: He walked up to the top of the hill…yonder.  I'll go seek him.  

[Exit PRINCE]

Falstaff: I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the            750
rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
not where. (*Am I supposed to have a horse?*)

[POINS comes on camera]
Poins: *(No I stole it, remember?)*

Falstaff: Oh... If I travel but four foot by the squier
further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
'scape hanging for killing that rogue! I have           755
forsworn his company every hour any time this two and
twenty years, and yet... I am bewitched with the
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!        760
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. *(Speeds up)* An 'twere
not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
ever chewed with a tooth. *(Almost yelling)* Eight yards of uneven        765
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
and the stone-hearted villains know it well enough:
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
  

[PRINCE whistles (or maybe SFX)]

Falstaff: (big sigh) (try several times to whistle properly)
A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you 770
rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!

Prince: Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
of travelers.  

Falstaff: Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 775
I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

Prince: Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.

Falstaff: I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, 780
good king's son.

Prince: Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler? I’m flattered you think me
So fit as to bear your weight.

Falstaff: Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
garters! *(Wow.... um (surprised by my intensity))* 
If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I'll
have ballads made on you all and sung to filthy 785
tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.

Poins: Money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going
to the king's exchequer.

Falstaff: Thou liest! *(now fancifully)* 'tis going to the king's tavern.

Prince: Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;

Falstaff: *Four?*

Prince: *Yeah we're missing characters.*

Falstaff: *Oh yeah, I forgot.*

Prince: Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'escape 800 
from your encounter, then they light on us.

Falstaff: How many be there of *them*?

Poins: Some eight or ten. (Wait….no…eleven..no…twelve.) 

Falstaff: Won't they rob us?

Prince: What, a coward, Sir John Paunch? *(Fancifully)* 805

Falstaff: Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt;
but yet no coward, Hal.

Prince: Well, we leave that to the proof.

Poins: Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him. 810
Farewell, and stand fast.

[FALSTAFF goes off camera]

Prince: Ned, where are our disguises?

Poins: Here, hard by: stand close.

[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS]

TODO: We need to find blankets or cloaks or something we can throw over ourselves as disguises!
  
Falstaff: Now, my masters, every man to his business.

[Enter the Travellers]

[POINS and PRINCE go off camera]

Traveler 1 (Angie):
Come, neighbor: let us lead our horses down
the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs. 820

Falstaff: *(Falstaff fights invisible army with sword)*
Stand! Halt! 

Traveler 2 (Renee):
Noooooo!

Falstaff: Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:
ah! you caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
hate us youth: down with them! 825
Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
fat chuffs: I would your store were here! 
*(drops script and loses place)*

Traveler 2 (Renee): *whispers "On bacons"*

Falstaff: *What line number?*

Traveler 1 (Angie): *Line 3,141,592*

Falstaff: *I don't believe it.*

Traveler 1 (Angie): *Check it!*

Falstaff:
*There it is, thanks!* On, bacons, on! What, ye knaves! we young men must live.
You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith. 

*(picks up a cardboard box)* 830

[Exit Falstaff]

[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]

Prince: Now should thou and I
rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it
would be argument for a week, laughter for a month 835
and a good jest forever.

Poins: Stand close; I hear them coming. (*whispers* whose coming again?)

[Both hide by covering their faces with their cloaks or ducking out of the webcam]

[Enter Falstaff]

Falstaff: Ah, look at this share! Then to horse
before day. If the Prince and Poins be not two 840
arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
no more valor in that Poins than in a wild-duck.

[PRINCE and POINS come out of hiding]

Prince: Your money! All of it!

Poins: You villain!

Falstaff: Take it!

  

[ FALSTAFF throws the cardboard box with corresponding bacon ]

[ FALSTAFF exits. ]

  

Prince: Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
So strongly that they dare not meet each other; 850
Falstaff sweats to death,
And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.

Poins: Ahhhh! (*big sigh of contentment*) How the rogue roar'd! 855

[EXIT]

Renee: What’s the next scene?
