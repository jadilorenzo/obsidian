Ah, back to the good old Boar’s Head Tavern yesterday. There’s nothing like the comforting embrace of familiar chaos, the aroma of ale, and the warmth of keen friends. How I missed the boisterous laughter and the truly knowing glances of Mistress Quickly. Truly, it’s the only place where a man of my girth, station, and taste can feel at home. Ah... The battlefield was no place for one such as I, though I played my part—most valorously, I might add. While others were busy hacking at each other like butchers at a slaughterhouse, I was crafting a singular legend. Prince Hal, my dear Hal... He saw through me, but what of it? There’s love in his eyes, even when he’s scolding me. The lad is growing into a princely mantle... Soon he will be king. I see it in his bearing... his newfound sense of duty. It won’t be long before our days of roguish revelry are but memories. Yet, I hold hope that his love for me, his old friend and mentor in the arts of merriment, will endure. By my troth, there’s a part of me that wonders how much longer this can last. Change is on the horizon, and even the Boar’s Head cannot remain untouched forever. For now, though, I will drink, laugh, and live in the moment, for tomorrow is uncertain, and today is glorious.
