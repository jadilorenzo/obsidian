### 1 Peter 5:5-11
Likewise, you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another and be clothed with humility, for
“God resists the proud,
But gives grace to the humble.”
Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.
Be sober, be vigilant; your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. To Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

Read 1 Peter 5:5-11

God loves the humble and wants you to rely on him fully, but be vigilant in resisting the devil's schemes because God will give you strength even in your suffering.

1. Summarize this passage in a few sentences. Point out things that immediately stand out to you and how they address your pursuit of freedom from sexual sin.
	Summary: Submit to those older and wiser than yourself. Be characterized by humility because "God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble." Humble yourself, because God will exalt you in his timing. Give your cares to him who cares for you. Be calm and aware, knowing that the devil is stalking you. Resist his temptation in the knowledge that all Christians have the same temptations and pain. But may God, after you have suffered a while, strengthen, perfect, establish, and settle you.
	Things to note:
	- Humility is repeated 3 times.
	- God cares for us.
	- Sexual temptation is common to all mankind.
	- The devil is real and planning your temptation.
	- God's goal is to strengthen and establish you.
2. In verses 5 (and 6), Peter commands humility, which is the opposite of pride. How does your sexual sin reveal your pridefulness?
	- It shows selfishness by the misuse of what God has given us. (which is pride)
	- Sexual sin denies God's omniscience and ignores God's ultimate justice. 
3. Peter quotes James 4:6 (similar to Proverbs 3:34) when he says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” What will it look like for you to humble yourself in your fight against pornography?
    - Confessing sin
    - Building walls to prevent temptation
    - Relying on God's strength 
    - “casting all your anxieties on him”
1. According to verse 6, what will God do when you have humbled yourself? As you answer, it’s important to remember who decides when it is “the proper time.” Part of being humble is submitting to God’s plan and sovereign purposes — especially when they go a different direction or take much longer than we would like.
    God gives grace to the humble, meaning he grants forgiveness and mercy to the humble. He promises to exalt and strengthen the humble at "the proper time," meaning in his good timing.
5. In verse 7, “casting all your anxieties on him” modifies “humble yourselves” in the previous verse; it elaborates for us. In other words, the way to humble yourself is to cast your anxieties on God because he cares for you. As you seek sexual purity, what worries, fears, concerns, and doubts do you need to cast on the Lord?
    The anxieties, worries, fears, concerns, and doubts revolve around the success or failure of our efforts toward sexual purity. We are commanded to give these to God in prayer.
6. Peter calls the devil your adversary, or your enemy. He wants to “devour” you. Do you feel like your sexual sin is devouring you? According to verses 8-9, it doesn’t have to. How can you be “sober-minded” and “watchful” in this area of your life? In other words, what can you do to be proactive about resisting your enemy (especially knowing you’re not alone)?
	Putting measures in place to avoid the temptation, such as making sinning more difficult, praying, and daily commitment, and confessing all shortcomings.
7. Reread verse 10. This pattern of suffering before entering into glory was modeled by Christ himself, as he had to suffer the punishment for our sin before being exalted at its defeat. How does it make you feel to know that your suffering for a little while will lead to God restoring, confirming, strengthening, and establishing you in eternal glory with Christ?
	It's hopeful to know that Christ has gone through worse than I have and will be there to strengthen me when I need it most.
	Christ's suffering and glorification give us hope for ourselves as we are in Christ.
	Christ also promises to protect us through our trials, which dispels every discouragement.
