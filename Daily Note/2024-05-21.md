#DailyNote 

Plan for today:
- [ ] Mom is leaving
- [ ] I need to get this paragraph (and preferably this essay) done before she leaves at 11ish (my guess)
- [ ] I need to have a high standard of focus for Matthew and I

Things I want to do:
- [ ] I need to write lyrics for my melody
	- [ ] This involves deciding on song structure changes
- [ ] I want to check the Tortured Poet's Society

FOCUS, LASER FOCUS!
