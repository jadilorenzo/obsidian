#DailyNote 

Today I am planning on working very diligently. 
I need to calc or writing. But neither of these is due soon. I might do RM hours.
Let me check my mail...
Never mind, both subjects not being due soon. I need to finish my mind map by Monday.

Mind map it is.

I should plan whether to try and meet with Josh Cardin for #Music  tomorrow (because it's Sunday.) It might not work because of the small group.

I'm planning on taking a break later to see if I can use `create-react-app` and `LM Studio` to, instead of using *any* logic for `tic-tac-toe`, just pass off the data and rules to an LLM and have the user provide corrections when it breaks the rules (such as declaring a wrong win or placing one tile on top of another.)
