6min recording delay

I did #RoleModel and #Music yesterday. Maffrine was telling me that songs have two "Motive"s that are expanded upon in the verse. Looking to understand the different types of musical motives and which ones I like.
TODO: ask chatGPT

Plan for today:
- [ ]  Get as much of the essay done as possible
- [ ] Might talk with Mom about her meeting
- [ ] Listen carefully to Han Zimmer
- [ ] Try and choose a second motive + research
