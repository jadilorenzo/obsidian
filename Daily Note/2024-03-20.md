#DailyNote 

I have a lot of #Calculus to do today: 6 problems left.
I want to get 4 done this morning.

Incident:
We agreed:
Matthew was silly at least three times after I asked him to not be silly
He said just "sorry" twice - one of which was preceded and followed by silliness
The last time he said sorry I asked "Do you even care?" and he responded "No" as a joke (which he said was not silliness)
I asked if he cared a second time and he said "I'm sorry" 
I then asked, "Can you tell me what you're going to do, instead of me telling you what you should do?" He reacted like that was overkill and said "I won't be silly (with a tone of "of course")"
He then said asking him "what are was going to do" and whether he meant it was too much.
