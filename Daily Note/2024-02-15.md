#DailyNote 

I got down at 7:16 to find the watch I lost yesterday. I ordered my Captain Disc. I need to finish my writing problem quickly to get to my writing assignment before 3:30.

##### Writing Assignment:
Reading. Please complete reading two pieces we began in class  
today:  
1) "The Fire," by Max Beerbohm, which begins on page 3-56;  
2) "Right and Wrong," by C. S. Lewis; begins on page 4-33.  
Annotate what you see, and come prepared to discuss.

Mom said to make sure not to become stagnant...
What will I do to continue growing and getting more done?
