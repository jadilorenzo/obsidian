#DailyNote 

I need to finish my essay's first draft today. (excepting intro and conclusion) Only got 3:30 hr work yesterday. Aiming higher today: 5:30hr work. I will, however, be taking Dad to the airport at 10:30.

I'm blessed with a great writing coach and music teacher. (Christiana also may help with writing.)

5 Paragraphs till the draft of the body is finished...

Shooting for 3 par this morning
