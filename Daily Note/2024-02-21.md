#DailyNote 

Well, yesterday, I had several unexpected interruptions. We went out to eat with Nana, but she didn't arrive until after we were all done eating, so we came home and talked with her while she ate. Then, Christian needed me to take him to the mechanic to pick up his car, so Christiana, Christian, and I all went to the shop together. Then after we came back and got to work, Jaqueline, Daniel, and the kids came over. 
Anyway, I have 3 calc problems left over and they look difficult...

Todo Today:
- 3 Calc problems
- Calc Class at 7
- Finish mindmap revision
- Maybe look at the essay?

Starting today at 8:21 because I moved rooms because Matthew is sick, but left my alarm.
