#DailyNote 

**I need** to get my Mindmap sent to Mr. Speed tonight. I would also like to get some #RoleModel hours in too. I am super excited about #Music Project 25. Joshua Cardin also came out with his [newest album](https://open.spotify.com/album/5OfhJQD6M2yaAd8f2uFYZr?si=eqgGmYtCQY6MUKgccL21_A](https://open.spotify.com/album/5OfhJQD6M2yaAd8f2uFYZr?si=eqgGmYtCQY6MUKgccL21_A "https://open.spotify.com/album/5OfhJQD6M2yaAd8f2uFYZr?si=eqgGmYtCQY6MUKgccL21_A").

Plan for today:
- Finish Mindmap
- 1-3hrs Rolemodel
- Music! (but not too much)
