#DailyNote 

I missed taking the trash out yesterday, so I had to take it out this morning and had trouble keeping my mind on track.

I am going to try and get my #Writing mind map finished ASAP before 3:30.

I also need to figure out how to reward my hard work when it happens... but till then, I'm going to hit my work hard.

Tried out `Ignite` and it has an ill-defined chord sequence.
