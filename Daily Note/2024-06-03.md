The Ego is the Enemy
My ego tells me to talk/think about what I will do instead of doing it.

Matthew is likely to be a bit distractible today.

Todo today:
- [ ] Get essay reviewed by mom
- [ ] Finish my own changes
- [ ] Get Modernity set up
- [ ] Create a real melody for these nice chords I came up with yesterday
- [ ] Start checkin meeting
