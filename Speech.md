Please tell us a short story about something in your life which leans into narrative tension while also being brief, clear and plausible. AND----here's the kicker---it does NOT have to be true.


As many of you know, I am in Utah.

And in the spirit of Utah being mormon... I hope Joseph Smith releases a new "holiday rendition" of the beatitudes that goes something like this. 

Blessed are the poor in spirit,  
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are they who mourn,  
for they will be comforted.

Blessed are the snowboarders,
for they need it.


Snowboarders deserve this blessing for two reasons.

First, snowboarders are typically addicted to danger. 
That requires a very special kind of blessing; the blessing of safety. 

That's why I love snowboarding and listening to What's Up Danger on full blast *at the same time.*

Second, snowboarders can't move along flat spaces.
Skiers have these things called poles that they use to traverse even the shortest stretches of flat snow. 
Snowboarders have this thing called momentum. That's the *only* way they cross flat places.


One time I was snowboarding and my mother had a brilliant idea. Let's go explore the other side of the mountain. 
Granted, it's fun to ski new runs and trails... but it's not fun enough to risk getting caught in a flat place. 
If I were to lose momentum in a flat place, I would have nothing to do but attempt the classic clumsy waddle or unstrap my boot. I, for one, was not particularly interested in  waddling. 

Nevertheless, I went with the family "to the other side". 
Once we arrived, since I was the only snowboarder in the group at the time, I set off on my own to try some of the harder runs.

And as it turned out, this side of the mountain wasn't as fun.  My family soon felt the same and left... Without me.

So I began to navigate my way back to the other other side of the mountain. The map I had was, lets just say, less than crystal clear. 

One of the few flaws of downhill skiing is that it is only down the hill. 
If you miss your exit, you HAVE MISSED YOUR EXIT.

Soon I found myself at the bottom of a part of the mountain that I had never even seen... Around my was nothing but flat ground... And one lift.

So I proceeded to commence the classic clumsy snowboard waddle over to the lift.

And guess what type of runs the lift serviced? No greens (those are the easy hills), no blues, no black diamonds. Just double black diamonds. In english, this means "straight cliffs." 

The lift even came with one of those special little orange signs with big skull face on it. This special delight read, "Experts only."

Now, since I didn't have my "external conscience that I call my mother" nearby, I proceeded to "give it try." Beats waddling all the way home. Right? Right?

So I got on the lift and decided it might be prudent to make sure I could actually get home. Like checking that these runs didn't just lead right back to where I started.
Luckily enough, there was an easy way home which happened to be a near cliff.

Never before in my life have I been glad to see moguls. 

Moguls are the big mounds of snow that form naturally from people skiing over a stretch of snow. You've probably seen them with the posh competitive skiers in spandex doin this little bounce thing. 

These mounds are nothing but pain for a snowboarders quads. They make the snowboarders have to use their knees as a suspension system.

In my case, I was thankful. The moguls were the only thing keeping the slope from being a literal cliff. It's like they were the rungs in a giant ladder, and it was my job to climb down with both my feet connected to the board.

Frankly, I ended up enjoying my ride down after the cliff became a bit less sheer. 
And eventually I made it to the lift that would take me to the other side of the mountain. 
Safe at last.

But hey! Now I have the story of the time I *accidentally* snowboarded my first double black diamond.
