**Follow-up On Schedule Adjustments**

Week after next I should be able to work all day Thursday and Friday, excepting a class I have from 11 A.M. - 2 P.M.. Till then, I will be keeping my current schedule. On the week of 8/24, I anticipate being able to work full-time, but I won't know about how much certain orientations will entail until closer to that date. After that week, I will be able to work in the office on Thursday till 2 P.M. and Friday all day.

I really appreciate the opportunity with RoleModel.
