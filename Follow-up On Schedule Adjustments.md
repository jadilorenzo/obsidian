**Follow-up On Schedule Adjustments**

Week after next I should be able to work all day Thursday and Friday, excepting a class I have from 11 A.M. - 2 P.M.. Till then, I will be keeping my current schedule. On the week of 8/24, I anticipate being able to work full-time, but I won't know about how much certain orientations will entail until closer to that date. After that week, I will be able to work in the office on Thursday till 2 P.M. and Friday all day.

I really appreciate the opportunity with RoleModel.


**Follow-up On Schedule Adjustments**

I will be out of town next week, but from the following week of 8/4 to the week of 8/25, I will be able to work all day Friday and all day Thursday except for an online summer class from 11 A.M. - 2 P.M. We're still finalizing next year's class schedule, but I'll likely have a class from 2 P.M to 4:10 P.M. on Thursdays.

Again, I appreciate the opportunity with RoleModel.
