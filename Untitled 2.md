Didn't Shakespeare write English?
Applause sounds between scenes!

*All turn on webcams.
Award silence...


Renee: Where's everybody else?

Angie: I heard something about a DnD game. *(Furiously scribbling on the script...)*

Jacob: I texted the group, Josh, Spence, and Adam about an hour ago, but I have not received a response. Looks like a couple of somebodies need to believe in being prepared. *(with disdain)*

Angie: Speaking of which, *(points at the camera with pencil)* do you have your costume?

Jacob: I'm supposed to have a costume?

Angie: Um, you’re playing Falstaff.

Jacob: *(looks around, gets up, and grabs a pillow from background)* I have one now!

Renee: How are we going to do the play with only three people?

Angie: *(looks up from rewriting the script)* I've been working on an alternate script in case we lost a few people. I can send it to you...

Jacob: Wait, you simplified the Shakespearean language, right?

Angie: Some.

Renee: *(with drama)* Alas, by my troth, Shakespeare's words despoiled and marred...

Angie: Let's just get this party started.

All go off camera...

Renee: Hey! Are you guys ready? Let’s get this show started!

  

Angie: Um… Jacob? Weren’t we all supposed to be in costume? We’re performing a play!

  

Jacob: Costume? What costume?

  

Angie: Jacob, you’re playing Falstaff, remember! 

  

Jacob: Oh, right. *pulls out pillow* I got it. 

  

Renee: Oh, guys, I don’t think I’m going to remember all my lines. 

  

Angie: It’s ok!! We just have to go for it. Everyone’s watching. 

  

Jacob: I’m ready as I’ll ever be! Wait, where’s Joshua and Adam?

  

Renee: Either they’re late or they completely forgot about this. They’re probably playing video games. 

  

Angie: Who’s going to play Poins…? Or the Prince?

  

Renee: We can’t wait for them. Uh, how about I’ll take the Prince and you can do Poins. 

  

Angie: But I don’t know the lines!

  

Jacob: You’ll

  

Renee: Alright, let’s start officially. Ladies and gentlemen, Henry IV Act 2! 

Is there sound? No? Ok who’s line is first?

  

Angie: Oh, that’s me!

  

*clears throat*
