Likewise, you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another and be clothed with humility, for
“God resists the proud,
But gives grace to the humble.”
Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.
Be sober, be vigilant; your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. To Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

Read 1 Peter 5:5-11

1. Summarize this passage in a few sentences. Point out things that immediately stand out to you and how they address your pursuit of freedom from sexual sin.
	God loves the humble and wants you to fully rely on him, but be vigilant to resist the devil's schemes because God will give you strength even in your suffering.
1. In verse 5 (and verse 6), Peter commands humility, which is the opposite of pride. How does your sexual sin reveal your pridefulness?
	You think you can do anything you want.
1. Peter quotes James 4:6 (similar to Proverbs 3:34) when he says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” What will it look like for you to humble yourself in your fight against pornography?
    Confessing it is humbling.
4. According to verse 6, what will God do when you have humbled yourself? As you answer, it’s important to remember who decides when it is “the proper time.” Part of being humble is submitting to God’s plan and sovereign purposes — especially when they go a different direction or take much longer than we would like.
    God says he "will give grace to the humble." (meaning forgiveness)
5. In verse 7, “casting all your anxieties on him” modifies “humble yourselves” in the previous verse; it elaborates for us. In other words, the way to humble yourself is to cast your anxieties on God because he cares for you. As you seek sexual purity, what worries, fears, concerns, and doubts do you need to cast on the Lord?
    You put in the work, but leave the results up to God.
6. Peter calls the devil your adversary, or your enemy. He wants to “devour” you. Do you feel like your sexual sin is devouring you? According to verses 8-9, it doesn’t have to. How can you be “sober-minded” and “watchful” in this area of your life? In other words, what can you do to be proactive about resisting your enemy (especially knowing you’re not alone)?
	Putting measures in place to avoid the temptation and confessing all shortcomings.
7. Reread verse 10. This pattern of suffering before entering into glory was modeled by Christ himself, as he had to suffer the punishment for our sin before being exalted at its defeat. How does it make you feel to know that your suffering for a little while will lead to God restoring, confirming, strengthening, and establishing you in eternal glory with Christ?
	It's hopeful to know that Christ has gone through worse than I have and will be there to strengthen me when I need it most.
