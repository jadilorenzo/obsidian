Jacob: Wow that’s a lot of words. Here we go!
  
Hotspur: 'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be
contacted to be there, in respect of the love I bear
your house.' He could be contacted: why is he not, 860
then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
he loves our house. 'The …. Porpoise you undertake is dangerous;'—why, that's
certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to 865
Drink; to read Shakespeare, but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The
purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
have named uncertain; the time itself unabsorbed; and
your whole plot too light for the counter piece of so 870
great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so, say you so, say you so? I say
unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind (hinned), and
you lie! What a lack-brain is this!
Our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our
friends true and consonant: a good plot, good 875
friends, a good plot, good friends,
and full of….expansion?; an excellent plot,
very good friends. What a frosty-sprinted rogue is
this! Why, my lord of Pork commends the plot and the
particulars of the proceedings. Pizazz, were I now by
this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.
(Woah, hold up! Am I threatening violence?)

Angelina: Yes, you’re threatening violence

Hotspur: *(You know what… I’m gonna just read it like I’d write it.)*

Lady Percy: *But-*

I mean what about dad, and Uncle Bob, and me?
Morty, my gracious lord of Pork, and GlowingTower?
Oh and then there’s whats that guys name again?

Lady Percy: Tis Douglas, but my lord, why hast thou marred thy speech?
  
Hotspur: Yeah, Doug.
But don't I have all their emails and phone numbers?
I even have a calendar event scheduled for the ninth of the next month!
This dude is such a dummy.
I would bet money, he's gonna tell Mr. King pants.
But, yeah dude. Whatever. 
I'm gonna have to get a move on.
  
[Enter LADY PERCY]
  
Ah, hello there wifey. I'm gonna have to hop-diggity to the airport.
Kiss me Kate, before I depart! 
Kiss me Kate! 895
  
Lady Percy: O, my good lord... *No, just no.*
But why are you thus alone?
For what offense have I this fortnight been
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep? 900
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy? 905
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents, 910
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
And all the currents of a heady fight.
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war 915
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
Such as we see when men restrain their breath 920
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
And I must know it, else he loves me not.
  
Hotspur: I legit have no idea what you just said. Minus maybe the "else he loves me not" part.
  
[Enter Servant] 925

Hotspur: Is Marcos with the packet gone?
  
Servant: He is, my lord, an hour ago.
  
Hotspur: Did the valet pull up the Maserati?
  
Servant: No, just the Mustang, my lord, he brought even now.
  
Hotspur: I'll be there shortly.
  
[Exit Servant]
  
Lady Percy: But hear you, my lord. 
*Why are you changing the lines? That’s not what the script said!*
  
Hotspur: What say'st thou, my lady?
  
Lady Percy: What is it carries you away?
  
Hotspur: Why, my Mustang, my love, my red Mustang.
  
Lady Percy: Out, you mad-headed ape! 940
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
As you are toss'd with. In faith,
I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
About his title, and hath sent for you 945
To line his enterprise: but if you go,—
Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
Directly unto this question that I ask:
In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry, 950
An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
  
Hotspur: Away,
Oh, come on now! Love? Not feeling it, Kate.
In this world, we can't just play around and make kissed faces. 
We need to be tough and take some hits. 
Kate, what do you want to talk about so bad?
  
Lady Percy: Do you not love me? do you not, indeed? 960
Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.

Hotspur: Come on! Aren't going to wave goodby and everything?
And once I'm in the car, (and gratefully out of your reach), I will swear 965
I love you infinitely. But seriously, Kate;
I can't have you always asking where I'm going
Where I must go, I must. And, in conclusion,
Toodles, gentle Kate. 970
I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
Than Harry Percy's wife: constant as you are,
You're still a woman: and as for secrecy...
I well believe you won't say what you don't know; 975
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.

Lady Percy: How! so far?

Hotspur: Not an inch farther. But listen Kate,
Today I will set forth, tomorrow you. 980
Will this make you happy, Kate?

Lady Percy: It must of force.

[Exeunt]
