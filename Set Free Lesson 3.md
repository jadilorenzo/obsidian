“Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.” Colossians 3:2-3

MAKING THE CONNECTION

“God gives us something that a 12-step program never can. He gives us a new identity in Jesus Christ. We’re not lost forever and chained to our old identity. In Jesus we are totally freed from that old person, that old man.” -Jeff Durbin

Have you ever felt like your addiction is just part of who you are? That it’s part of your nature? Before you believed in Christ, it was! Apart from Christ, sin comes as naturally as breathing; it defines us and it is our identity when God looks at us. Ephesians 2:1-3 teaches us that because of our sin we are spiritually dead, “sons of disobedience,” and naturally “children of wrath.” Is there a worse way to be identified? But after diagnosing the absolute desperation caused by our sin, the next couple of verses give us a tremendous amount of hope:

“But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved....” (Ephesians 2:4-5)

In other words, because of God’s great love, he has shown us extreme mercy and given us a new life through Christ even though our sin meant he didn't have to. This is grace! Out of someone else’s sheer goodness, we get what we don’t deserve. We’re saved from our old self, sin, and death, and given new life, a new self, a new identity in Christ only because God loves us and showed us mercy.

But what does it mean now to live in that new life, to have a new identity in Christ? Sometimes you still act like your old self; you still do the same things you did before you became a Christian. You still have this addiction that keeps you in chains. You know the gospel and remind yourself of it, but still find yourself living a life of shame and regret because of your addiction.

GETTING IN THE WORD

When Paul wrote his letter to the church in the small city of Colossae, he was likely imprisoned in Rome. The goal of his letter was to encourage the Colossian church in their beliefs, and respond to the threat of false teaching that would hinder their spiritual growth and maturity. Although we don’t know the precise nature of the dangerous teaching facing the Colossians, we do know that Paul’s answer was Christ — how supreme he is over all creation, and sufficient he is to help us in our daily pursuit of holiness.

These words were penned almost 2,000 years ago, yet they remain just as relevant to our own churches and personal struggles today. We have to be on guard against any teaching that would have us believe we have the power to break the chains of sexual addiction on our own. We need a miracle — and we’re promised one in Colossians 3. By the time we arrive at Colossians 3, Paul has already repeatedly called attention to the work of Christ on behalf of his people, as well as alluded to the idea that in Christ we have a new identity (1:12-14: 1:21- 23;)

Read Colossians 3:1-17

If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.
Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience, in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.
But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth. Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all.

1. Summarize this passage in a few sentences. Point out things that immediately stand out to you and how they address your addiction.
	Since you have been saved with christ, your focus should be on spiritual things. Your old life and way of thinking has been buried with Christ. So therefore, change your way of living. You have become a new man, so put off the old man who is renewed and sustained by christ.
	Addiction is a part of the old man.
	God's wrath is coming upon the sons of disobedience for pornography.
1. Reread verses 1-4. Where have you found your identity in the past? In what five ways does Paul now identify you with Christ? How do you feel reading that this is what has happened (and will happen) to you because of your union with Christ?
    I'm still figuring out my identity, but it's tempting to define yourself with reference only to yourself and not the one who saved your soul. We are raised with Christ, hidden with Christ, alive in Christ, and renewed by Christ. I'm reminded of God's care for me.
3. Paul encourages you to set your mind on “things that are above” twice in verses 1-2, and contrasts them with things that are on earth. What things do you think he has in mind? In the battle against sexual sin, how does it help to set your mind on these things that are above?
	He could have any vice in mind: greed, lust, deceit. The decision against pornography is a decision to delay gratification. Sin is in opposition to "things above." God has greater joys than self-pleasure.
1. As he often does in his writing, Paul elaborates by writing out two opposing lists; the first is the “put to death these things” and don’t-be-like-this list — the bad one. But what is our motivation for killing those sins? (hint: “therefore”)
    Because Christ has saved us from our sin, we aught to reject sin at every turn.
5. Since your new identity in Christ leads to the death of those sins, now you have freedom to walk in a new way, to be a new person. As a new person, how do you become less and less like the old person (v 10)? What needs to change in your life in order to be “renewed in knowledge”? More time in the Bible? Connect with a local church or community of believers? Reading something different or watching something different on television, computer, phone, tablet, etc.? Be specific.
    Sanctification involves a realignment of desires. You will become more like christ, more loving, serving, genuine, caring, joyful, intentional. I still need to pray more. I need to serve others more (Matthew specifically.)
6. Reread the two lists; the negative one (verses 5-9) and the positive one (verses 12-17). Notice that each section contains both actions to stop doing, and actions to start doing. But they also reveal negative and positive ways to be or not be, things that have to do with your character — who you are on the inside. Go through each section slowly and evaluate yourself. Which things on the bad list are you growing away from? In which things are you stagnant? On the good list, where are you growing, and where do you need to grow?
    I'm asking Christ to remove my evil desires. I need to work on my truthfulness.
7. Notice all the active commands in verses 5-14: put to death, put them all away, do not lie, put on, bear with one another, forgive, put on love. Now read verses 15-16. How are these two verses similar to each other? How are they different from verses 9-14 in what they command?
    These verses command that we "let" Christ to his work in us.
1. Can pornography and the peace of Christ rule in your heart simultaneously? Can lust and addiction remain if the word of Christ is dwelling in you richly? Why or why not?
    Sin doesn't have room when we are meditating and filling ourselves on God's great love for us.

NOW WHAT

As you wage war against sexual sin, remember that when you died with Christ your old nature (identity) died as well. Now that your life is hidden in his, your life can reflect Christ’s. That’s the good news of the gospel! You’ve been forgiven, set free, given a new life, a fresh start, and you’re not who you were before you put your faith in Christ. You don't even have to be who you were yesterday. Your identity in Christ empowers you to live in freedom from your old sin.

What can you do today in order to address some of the changes we read about in the passage? Taking this course is a great start. Spend time in the Bible; learn about what God says, the promises and warnings he makes, and how your story fits into his. Pray for new desires. Pray for strength to fight! Do some honest evaluation and consider sharing your journey with a trusted friend or spiritual mentor. Let the gospel do its work; as your heart and mind are renewed with knowledge, you will see your desires and actions begin to change. As Jeff said at the end of the video, sin will lose its luster — and as it does, it will lose its power over you!
