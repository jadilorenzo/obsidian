[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS on webcam]

Poins: Come: I have removed Falstaff's

horse, and he frets like a scholar betwixt his freedom and his finals. 

  

Prince: Stand close. Let us wait for him. 

  

[Enter FALSTAFF]

  

Falstaff: Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins! 745

  

Prince: Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost

thou keep!

  

Falstaff: Where's Poins, Hal?

  

Prince: He walked up to the top of the hill…yonder.  I'll go seek him.

  

Falstaff: I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the            750

rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know

not where. 

(Wait, was I supposed to have a horse? Where’s my horse. Oh, no horse? That’s right. Never mind. Anyway…)

If I travel but four foot by the squier

further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt

not but to die a fair death for all this, if I

'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have           755

forsworn his company hourly any time this two and

twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the

rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me

medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it

could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!        760

Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!

I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere

not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to

leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that

ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven        765

ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;

and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:

a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!

  

[They whistle]

  

Whew! (try several times to whistle properly)

A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you 770

rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!

  

Prince: Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close

to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread

of travelers.

  

Falstaff: Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 775

'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot

again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.

What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

  

Prince: Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.

  

Falstaff: I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, 780

good king's son.

  

Prince: Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler? I’m flattered you think me

So fit as to bear your weight.

  

Falstaff: Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent

garters! (uh…ok) If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I

have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy 785

tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest

is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.

  

Poins: Money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going

to the king's exchequer.

  

Falstaff: You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.

  

Prince: Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;

Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'escape 800 

from your encounter, then they light on us.

How many be there of them?

  

Poins: Some eight or ten. (Wait….no…eleven..no…twelve.) 

  

Falstaff: 'Zounds, will they not rob us?

  

Prince: What, a coward, Sir John Paunch? 805

  

Falstaff: Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;

but yet no coward, Hal.

  

Prince: Well, we leave that to the proof.

  

Poins: Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:

when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him. 810

Farewell, and stand fast.

  

Falstaff: Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.

  

Prince: Ned, where are our disguises?

  

Poins: Here, hard by: stand close.

  

[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS]

We need to find blankets or cloaks or something we can throw over ourselves as disguises!

  

Falstaff: Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:

every man to his business.

  

[Enter the Travellers]

  

Travelers can be the voices of Poins and the Prince, but off webcam. This will make it look like there are more actors than there really are. 

  

First Traveller (Angie):

Come, neighbor: let us lead our horses down

the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs. 820

  

Falstaff: (act like you’re wielding a sword or attacking someone)

Stand! Halt! Hold up!

  

Traveler 2:

Please, no!

  

Falstaff: Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:

ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they

hate us youth: down with them: fleece them. 825

  

Traveler 1:

Thou hath insulted me and my neighbor! How could you! You bastard!

  

Traveler 2: 

  
  

Falstaff: Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye

fat chuffs: I would your store were here! 

Uh…… oh what was my line….. I remember it was something strange

  

Traveler 2: *whispers* On bacons on

  

Oh, that’s right! On, bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.

You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.

  

And, I’m supposed to be tying you up right now, ok? Just, act tied up. 

    830

[Exit Falstaff]

[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]

  

Prince: The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou

and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it

would be argument for a week, laughter for a month 835

and a good jest for ever.

  

Poins: Stand close; I hear them coming. (*whispers* whose coming again?)

  

Both hide by covering their faces with their cloaks or ducking out of the webcam. 

  

[Enter Falstaff]

  

Falstaff: Ah, look at this share! Then to horse

before day. The Prince and Poins be not two 840

arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's

no more valor in that Poins than in a wild-duck.

  

Now the Prince and Poins come out of hiding. 

  

Prince: Your money! All of it!

  

Poins: You villain!

  

Falstaff: Take it!

  

[ Falstaff throws a bag-ish prop and Poins/Prince pick up something on their end.

Falstaff exits. ]

  

Prince: Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:

The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear

So strongly that they dare not meet each other; 850

  

Falstaff sweats to death,

And lards the lean earth as he walks along:

Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.

  

Poins: How the rogue roar'd! 855

  

[Exeunt]

  

Renee: What’s the next scene?
