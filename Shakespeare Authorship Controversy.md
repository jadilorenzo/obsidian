ASSIGNMENT: Research the controversy of Shakespeare's authorship and how it has developed over time. Write a 1/2 - 1 page summary and response to the controversy.

The "Shakespeare Authorship Controversy" is the ongoing debate asking this question: "Could the Shakespeare, born in Stratford the son of a glove-maker, be the true author of the greatest English plays in history?" People who argue against the Strafordian Shakespeare, called anti-Stratfordians, often argue based on a lack of evidence. For instance, they posit "Shakespeare couldn't have written his plays because there is no record of Shakespeare having any formal education." However, such records would likely be missing after so many years. They also argue that "Shakespeare couldn't have written so many plays set in Italy or in royal courts because he had never seen them." However, a contemporary of Shakespeare, Thomas Kidd, wrote the Spanish Tragedy which involves the Spanish court which Kidd had also never seen.

Again, they argue "Shakespeare couldn't have written plays with such significant influence from classical plays because he wouldn't have read the classics without higher education." However, grammar schools of the time often taught students to read untranslated classical plays from Seneca and others. 

Around 1920, Centuries after Shakespeare died in 1616, Shakespeare's contemporary, Edward de Vere, emerged as a potential alternate author of the plays attributed to Shakespeare. The case for Edward de Vere is strong: 14 of Shakespeare’s plays are set in Italy – the country De Vere visited in 1575
