Dear Jack,

Fie. Fie. A plague upon dishonest thieves. Poins, the miserable wretch. Would that I had the fortune to be his executioner. "See. Poins? How do you like my noose? What a lovely set of garters you have there..." Take my horse! I'll take your legs. I'll gnaw your ankles. Try running a score miles without them. Hang!  A plague on all cowards. We might have stood the chance against that onslaught if Gadshill and Peto had turned tail like feral rabbits. I was outnumbered! What more could I have done? Have I no staff or support in my old age? But the Prince and Poins... A plague on all cowards. The plan was fixed. The reward sure. The prize was in our hands. Oh to be robbed of 4,000 pounds to a dozen men on the highway. And anon Poins and his Grace the Prince wilt expect an explanation to be forthcoming.

With greatest respect,
Jack Falstaff
