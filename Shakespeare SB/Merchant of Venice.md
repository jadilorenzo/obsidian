Based on Act 1, write 2-3 paragraphs describing how Shakespeare portrays the hatred between Shylock and the Christians and vice versa.Â  Bring your paper to class.

Shylock hates Antonio for being a Christian. However, this hatred of Christians is overwhelmed by Shylock's hatred of Antonio's philanthropy as it "brings down, the rat of usance with us here in Venice." (1.3.38) It seems Shylock connects Antonio's charity and seeming simplicity with his religion.

Antonio hates Shylock as he is a Jew. Although he never claims to hate Jews, Antonio indicates that if Shylock weren't a Jew, Shylock would have been nicer. He says, "The Hebrew will turn Christian, he grows kind." Furthermore, Shylock says that Antonio rails against *him* in the streets (specifically his practice of usury) and not his religion.

In summary, both Shylock and Antonio hate each other for their religion. However, Shylock's hatred of Christianity sprouts from his hatred of Antonio. On the other hand, Antonio despises the Jew (and treats him worse proportionately) because of what he does and, assumes it is because of his religion and worldview.
