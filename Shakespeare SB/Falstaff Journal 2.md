Embowlled! Ha not for the gold in pharaoh's coffin, be I embowlled. Nay! Not for the magisterial honor of his great pyramids either. What a caper! There I was, sprawled like a beached whale, playing dead... and with much discretion... avoiding the parting arrows of outrageous fortune. "Two stars can not in one sphere be contained..." Hal, my boy, how much you take after your dear teacher. Mind, if you were to but to become my size the two of us would be like twins. Speaking of which, his grace the king shall have good need of grace if he does not reward me properly. I deserve to be Duke or Earl at least... I could think of quite a few vacancies of late. Or, if not, perhaps governor of my lowly Eastcheap with a solid endowment to my purse and... ooh perchance an ever-flowing tab of sack for me to live comfortably as a gentleman.
