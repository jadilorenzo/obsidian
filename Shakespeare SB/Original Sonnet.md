Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou are more mild and more temperate.

1. Choose a topic with a universal theme.

Theme - The main idea of a literary work in which the author expresses his opinion.

Universal theme - a theme that connects all humankind across time and space. (loss, love, friendship, etc.)

2. Look at other sonnets for inspiration, if needed.

3. Begin writing sentences or phrases introducing the theme, including a “character.” Each stanza should act as a miniature paragraph. Around line 8 or 9, present the reader with a problem or concern regarding your subject. In the third stanza (lines 9-12), bring the conflict to a climax, or turning point. In lines 13-14, resolve the conflict. It doesn’t have to be a concrete ending - maybe it’s an acceptance of what has happened in the rest of the sonnet.

4. After you have the draft of the sonnet, begin applying the sonnet form:

is the light of the body the eyes or the mind?
“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!"
or is it the mind's eye

Would I have made life's song a chapel hymn

Electricity (lightning and in the brain)

Had I thought I held my life in my hand,
Would I have made life's song a chapel hymn?
What substance is man if man, none can see?
A glass vessel filled with coarse streaming sand
What substance is man, if man none can see?
Is darkness worth obstacles unperceived?
Time, the invisible glass streaming sand
Is louder than a screaming sea to me.
Neurons electricity firing
Does brightness and banging stay cognition?
Does brightness and banging free conception?
Is silence empty if emptiness is silent?
Is silence empty if silence is empty?
Is silence void if silence void of sound is?

Am I shadow if in the dark I stand?
What substance am I, if man's form none see?
Is it man that surely rules sweeping land?
Shall mere man subjugate the stormy sea?

Dark silence deafened by silent lightning,
The mind electrified in perception.
Is dark danger worth such enlightening?
Does light permit the same deep conception?

But is darkness shame if shame it conceals?
Is silence void if void of overture?
What if light and loud sound too much reveals?
So keen insight is dulled by exposure.

I'll resume my muse whether or not I'm right,
And let you stumble in your world of light.


Leave me to my minds eye
And I'll leave you to your 

Leave me to my thoughts
And I'll leave you to your rushing/business

meditation
musings

rushing
hurried fixation
buzzings

I'll resume my muse whether or not I'm right,
And let you stumble in your world of light.


overpower for brightness
In the dark
