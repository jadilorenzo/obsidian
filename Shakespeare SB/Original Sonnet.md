Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou are more mild and more temperate.

1. Choose a topic with a universal theme.

Theme - The main idea of a literary work in which the author expresses his opinion.

Universal theme - a theme that connects all humankind across time and space. (loss, love, friendship, etc.)

2. Look at other sonnets for inspiration, if needed.

3. Begin writing sentences or phrases introducing the theme, including a “character.” Each stanza should act as a miniature paragraph. Around line 8 or 9, present the reader with a problem or concern regarding your subject. In the third stanza (lines 9-12), bring the conflict to a climax, or turning point. In lines 13-14, resolve the conflict. It doesn’t have to be a concrete ending - maybe it’s an acceptance of what has happened in the rest of the sonnet.

4. After you have the draft of the sonnet, begin applying the sonnet form:
