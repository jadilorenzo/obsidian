These people don't know me
Don't know me at all
Cause When I am running
They don't see me fall
Cause I'm hiding
Hiding myself

This world is so busy 
I feel so alone
And when I go running
I just want my home
Cause I'm hiding
Hiding myself

I'm building these walls
watching them fall
alone by myself
just crying for help
Cause I'm here
and I'm real
So why do I hide
Behind this mask [rhyme this line?!]

My motto's be another
don't be yourself
no one's gonna love
someone who needs help
so I'm hiding 
hiding myself

I'm building these walls
watching them fall
alone by myself
just crying for help
Cause I'm here
and I'm real
So why do I hide
Behind this mask [rhyme this line?!]

But this is exhausting
I'm tired of this
All this running, all this hiding
So I'll break down the doors
leap from the floor
cause I'm tired
of hiding myself

I built all these walls
now I'll tear them down
not alone anymore
not afraid to implore
cause I'm here
and I'm real
And I won't hide
won't hide myself
behind a mask
