Create a 10 minute presentation on a topic that you believe people should shift their attitude on that follows the classical arrangement.

1. Exordium: The exordium aims to make the audience attentive, receptive, and disposed to listen.  Here the speaker usually introduces the main idea and purpose of the speech.
    
2. Narratio:  The speaker lays out the facts of a case or the contours of an issue.  
    
3. Partitio: The speaker provides a “map” of the presentation to help the listener track and remember.  The partitio routinely included definitions and differences between the speaker’s case and that of her opponent.  
    
4. Confirmatio: This fourth part takes up the bulk of the presentation.  In it, the speaker explains the main supporting arguments for the case.  
    
5. Refutatio: Here, the speaker raises and answers counterarguments to the previous supporting arguments.
    
6. Peroratio: The peroratio provides a summary of the presentation.  It often includes a final, explicit appeal to the listener’s emotions.  
    

Tools you need to remember and use:

- Perspective Triangle: Normative perspective, Situational perspective, and Personal perspective (Chapter 4) This is helpful to look at as you work on arguments, but we do not expect to 'see' this if you will, in your final speech.
    
- Be sure to establish stasis before making your argument (Chapter 5)
    
- Consider Aristotle’s ethos, pathos, and logos  (Chapter 9)
    
- Consider the 5 Cannons of Rhetoric: invention, arrangement, style, memory and delivery (Chapter 10)
    
- Christopher Alexander’s Patterns of Life (Chapter 10) Again, this can be helpful to shape your speech, but we are not looking for you to point this out to us.
    
- If you choose to incorporate a story be sure to remember dilemmas, tension, obstacle, goal, risk, echoes and surprises (Chapter 13-16)
    
- Be prepared to answer questions not only from the teacher, but also from the students regarding your topic.
