MAKING THE CONNECTION

“You may say, ‘I just don’t know if I can.’ The bottom line is, you can’t set yourself free — but there is another. There is one who came for you; his name is Jesus. He came to set you free.” -Toby Sumpter

Pornography and sexual addiction are complex, oftentimes deep-rooted sins. They have far- reaching effects, both in our own personal lives as well as on the culture around us. The

endgame of lust is evil beyond what many Christians would readily admit, including such heinous acts as addiction, abuse, human trafficking, and abortion. Yet the pornography industry is worth billions, and is so in part because of Christians’ participation in it.

Despite the evils of the industry, the warnings in Scripture, and the familiar guilt and shame that follow every indulgence, many well-meaning Christians still give in regularly. You know the risk of being found out; you know it will only temporarily satisfy because you’ll feel empty again after. In your sane moments, you know it’s wrong and you want to change. But then there are those moments when you just can’t seem to control it.

You can probably identify with Paul in Romans 7. If you want to do right and continue to fail, if you want to stop sinning but find yourself doing it anyway — Paul’s words may soothe your soul as you see that even the apostle Paul —author of about half of the New Testament — struggled with indwelling sin. This is the experience of every Christian in one way or another. As Paul laments his ongoing battle with sin, and longs to be freed from it, he is driven in verses 24-25 to the only one who is able to finally set us free: “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!”

GETTING IN THE WORD

Paul’s letter to the Romans is, in many ways, his magnum opus. It is an extensive treatment of the redemptive story, including the curse of sin, the righteousness of God, the inadequacy of the Law to save, the work of Christ and God’s sovereign purposes, and it concludes with several chapters devoted to practical instructions for the Christian life.

Tucked in the middle of the book is Chapter 7, where Paul has been explaining that the Law (the whole of the law given to Moses on Mount Sinai) is good; the Law itself is not sinful, even though it is through the Law that we define sin. In other words, Paul says, you wouldn't know what it means to covet if the Law didn’t instruct you about covetousness (v 7). Even worse, when the Law forbids something, it awakens our rebelliousness and we want to do it even more (vs 8-9)! Perhaps you can relate. So what hope can we have as we live the Christian life? Like Paul, where can we look for deliverance and hope as we struggle with the reality of our own sin?

Read Romans 7:13-25

Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that it is good. But now, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find. For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice. Now if I do what I will not to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.
I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!
So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.

1. Summarize this passage in a few sentences. Point out things that immediately standout to you and how they address your addiction.
	Despite good intentions, sin often takes control, resulting in actions against one’s will. This struggle is ongoing, with the mind wanting to follow God’s law while the flesh is drawn to sin. Deliverance from "this body of death" comes only through Jesus.

	1. There’s a struggle between the desire to do good and the pull toward sin.
	2. Sin overrides good intentions.
	3. Deliverance from this struggle is only found through Jesus Christ.
2. Do you feel like Paul? How does it make you feel when you continue in the very sin from which you desire freedom?
	The inner conflict Paul describes here is incredibly relatable. You feel like you can't control yourself.
3. Look at verse 13. What is the purpose of God’s Law?
	To show us our sin and convict us.
4. Paul says he wants to do the right thing, but continues to do what he hates. Even though he wants to do good, he can’t! In the experience of your sexual sin, can you relate to him in verses 15-20? How?
    The loss of control and the fact that you wish you weren't doing what you're doing.
5. Sin is a lifelong reality; just because we’re saved by Christ doesn’t mean we’re made perfect in this life immediately. According to this passage, when will we be finally, totally freed from the battle against indwelling sin?
    You will only be completely separated from sin by death.
6. Reread verse 21. Have you experienced this in past attempts at finding freedom from sexual sin? Have you found that when you commit to be obedient, temptation and evil seem to be even closer to you? How?
    There's an inner voice of what your body wants that screams at you so loud it becomes difficult to hear your conscience.
7. Notice in verses 24-25 that Paul does not shy away from his sin, or the condition in which it’s left him. He doesn’t give excuses or try to justify it. Instead, what does he conclude is the ultimate solution to the problem of sin? As you do what you can to guard yourself — as you do whatever it takes — why is it important to remember that you can’t deliver yourself from your sin with clever tactics, but that it’s Jesus who will deliver you?
	Because the true fix to sin is a new heart and realigned desires. Jesus is the only source for new hearts.
8. How does this passage encourage you in your own struggle with sin?
	Pauls message is relatable and clearly expresses what I've felt before.

NOW WHAT

This passage hints at the already and the not yet aspects of our salvation in Christ. Elsewhere in Romans and in many of Paul’s other writings, he describes the already of our salvation, what Christ has accomplished (past tense) in the lives of his people. Jesus has delivered us from the penalty of sin, and made us righteous before God. But there’s a not yet aspect of our salvation as well; at Christ’s return we will be finally and fully saved from the presence and power of sin.

As Christians we live in the tension of this already/not yet salvation today. It’s a mystery how we can be justified and righteous before God this very moment, while still being acutely aware of the presence (and the amount) of sin in our lives. Like Paul, we know the right thing to do and we want to do it, but it seems like sin always wins the day.

If you’re sick of losing the battle and ready to make war against sexual sin, follow the example of Paul. Stop justifying it or making excuses. Own it, and cry out with Paul, “Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God though Jesus Christ!” Yes, you need to do whatever is in your power; do whatever it takes. It may be extreme, but the idols must be destroyed. As Jesus said, cut off your hand if it causes you to sin. So hate your sin and do what you must, but at the end of the day rest in the power of Christ to set you free.

Paul ends Chapter 7 with the crescendo of Christ’s victory over our sin and slavery. Between now and the next session, read Chapter 8 to continue Paul’s thoughts and see how the saving work of Christ empowers us to live life in the Spirit.
