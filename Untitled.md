Portia's suitors choose the incorrect caskets because they make assumptions about the items' outward appearance.

Create your version of the casket riddle. Use three items - two of which hold a curse, a warning, or an unwanted item, and one of which holds a blessing, praise, or desired item. You may use three real containers or three drawings/sketches/electronic renderings. Write riddles of 1-3 sentences for each. Compose a Shakespearean-style sonnet using the caskets as a theme. The theme may be subtle or overt but should be identifiable. Be prepared to share the project with the class.

Create or use three separate items as caskets or containers for the riddles. Caskets may be hand-drawn or digitally rendered OR may be physical items.

Write three riddles, one for each casket or container. Each riddle should be 1-3 sentences.

Write an original, themed Shakespearean-style sonnet with 14 lines, iambic pentameter, and ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG rhyme scheme.


I have a 3d rendering of three boxes, one a metal outline for a glass core filled with blue liquid (and zero headspace) with a wire inside leading to either a chip or ignition device. The second is a safe box with a 10-digit keypad embedded in glass on the circular dial on the front; its sides are made of gold while the rest is made of dark blue material. The third is a black box with rounded edges and no emblem or other notable features.
