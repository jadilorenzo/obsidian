Portia's suitors choose the incorrect caskets because they make assumptions about the items' outward appearance.

Create your version of the casket riddle. Use three items - two of which hold a curse, a warning, or an unwanted item, and one of which holds a blessing, praise, or desired item. You may use three real containers or three drawings/sketches/electronic renderings. Write riddles of 1-3 sentences for each. Compose a Shakespearean-style sonnet using the caskets as a theme. The theme may be subtle or overt but should be identifiable. Be prepared to share the project with the class.

Create or use three separate items as caskets or containers for the riddles. Caskets may be hand-drawn or digitally rendered OR may be physical items.

Write three riddles, one for each casket or container. Each riddle should be 1-3 sentences.

Write an original, themed Shakespearean-style sonnet with 14 lines, iambic pentameter, and ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG rhyme scheme.


I have a 3d rendering of three boxes, one a metal outline for a glass core filled with blue liquid (and zero headspace) with a wire inside leading to either a chip or ignition device. The second is a safe box with a 10-digit keypad embedded in glass on the circular dial on the front; its sides are made of gold while the rest is made of dark blue material. The third is a black box with rounded edges and no emblem or other notable features.

### **Riddles for the Caskets:**

1. **Metal Outline with Glass Core (Bomb):**

Encased in glass, a liquid pure and blue,
Its gentle glow a tempting, luring sight.
But within lies a force both fierce and true,
A touch ignites a blaze that burns the night.

2. **Safe Box with Keypad (Bomb):**

A treasure trove awaits behind these walls,
A golden box of promise and of dread.
Yet digits here may toll the fatal calls,
And secrets kept may leave the seeker dead.

3. **Black Box (Secret Message):**

In shadowed form, the silent answer lies,
No emblem marks the path to what you seek.
Within this vessel, truth’s quiet surprise,
A whispered word to those who dare to peek.

  

**Sonnet on the Theme of Risk and Revelation:**

Three paths converge where destiny awaits,
Each box a test for those who dare to choose.
In gleaming glass, destruction’s ire abates,
In digits’ dance, the careless stand to lose.

The darkest box conceals its humble guise,
No mark to show the promise held within.
Yet those who trust beyond the crafted lies,
Unlock the message where true hope begins.

In choices made, our fates are thus entwined,
A lesson learned through trials we endure.
For wisdom’s key, within the heart confined,
Reveals the path where secrets find their cure.

In every choice, the soul must weigh its cost,
For in the end, it finds what it has lost.
