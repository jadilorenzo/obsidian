Lesson 1: The Purposes and Types of Definitions,
1. ﻿﻿﻿What is a term?
	A concept expressed precisely in words.
﻿﻿﻿2. What is the connection between a term and a word?
	﻿﻿﻿A term is represented by a word, though a word may have more than one meaning.
	﻿﻿﻿One word can carry the meaning of many terms; the same term can be expressed with different words.
﻿﻿﻿3. What does it mean to define a term?  What are six purposes for defining terms?
	﻿Definitions show relationships.
	﻿Definitions remove ambiguous﻿﻿.
	﻿Definitions reduce vagueness.
	﻿Definitions increase vocabulary.
	﻿Definitions can explain concepts theoretically.
	﻿Definitions can influence attitudes.
﻿﻿﻿4. What are the five types of definitions?
	﻿﻿﻿lexical 
	﻿﻿﻿precising 
	﻿﻿﻿stipulative 
	﻿﻿﻿theoretical 
	﻿﻿﻿persuasive
﻿﻿﻿5. Which types would you likely find in a dictionary?
	﻿﻿﻿lexical 
	﻿﻿﻿theoretical
﻿﻿﻿6. What is an ambiguous word?
	﻿﻿﻿An ambiguous word is one which has multiple meanings.
﻿﻿﻿1. What is a vague word?
	﻿﻿﻿A vague word is one that has has unclear extent (precising definition).
﻿﻿﻿2. What is a lexical definition?
	﻿﻿﻿A definition that shows relationships or reduces ambiguity by providing a single, established meaning of a term.
﻿﻿﻿3. What is a precising definition?
	A precising definition seeks to make what was unclear or fuzzy more precise according to the needs at hand.
﻿﻿﻿1. What is a stipulative definition?
	﻿﻿﻿A stipulative definition is a stipulated definition, meaning the definer says this word means this thing in this instance.
﻿﻿﻿2. What is a theoretical definition?
	﻿﻿﻿A theoretical definition is a definition that explains a particularly theory behind a term, such as "H2O" for "water."
﻿﻿﻿3. What is a persuasive definition?
	﻿﻿﻿A persuasive definition aims to change a listener's view of a term by changing the definition.

Lesson 2: Genus and Species
﻿﻿﻿1. What is a genus?
	﻿﻿﻿A genus is the category or broader idea behind a species.
﻿﻿﻿2. What is a species? 
	﻿﻿﻿A species is a more specific instance of a genus.
﻿﻿﻿3. Can a term be both the genus of one term and the species of another?
	﻿﻿﻿Of course
﻿﻿﻿1. What are some of the common errors made in constructing genus and species charts?
	﻿﻿﻿overlapping species
	﻿﻿﻿ambiguous terms
	﻿﻿﻿part/whole

Lesson 3: Extension and Intension
1. ﻿﻿﻿What is the extension of a term?
	The extension of a term is the sum of all the individual objects to which the term applies.
2. What is the intension of a term?
	The intension of a term is the sum of it's common attributes.
3. How are extension and intension related in any given genus and species chart?
	The higher the term the greater the extension and the smaller the intension.

Lesson 4: Methods of Defining
1. ﻿﻿﻿What are three methods of defining terms?
	 synonym 
	 genus and difference
	 example
1. Do other methods exist?
	Yes
2. What are some limitations of defining by synonym?
	Not every word has a synonym
3. What are some rules for defining by example?
	Must include several varied examples
4. How is a term defined by genus and difference?
	Stating the genus of a term and then describing what differentiates that term from every other term in it's genus.

Lesson 5: Rules for Defining by Genus and Difference
1. What are the six rules for defining by genus and difference?
	A definition should state the essential attributes of the term.
	A definition should not be circular.
	A definition should not be too broad nor too narrow.
	A definition should not be unclear or figurative.
	A definition should be stated positively, if possible.
	A definition should be of the same part of speech as the term.
1. Can you restate these rules in your own words?
	Should include all essential attributes
	Shouldn't contain the word you're trying to define
	Should have the same extension and intension as the term.
	Should be literal
	Should state what thing thing is — not what it isn't
1. What is the difference between an essential and an accidental attribute?
	An essential attribute is the cause of accidental attributes
2. What are three ways that a definition can be unclear?
	If it uses ambiguous words that create ambiguous definitions
	If it gives you only tangential/accidental attributes
	If it simply quotes a common cliché
