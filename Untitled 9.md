As a child, I was drawn to dangerous things. When unloading the dishwasher, I would pick up the knives, drop into a fighting stance, and imagine a fearsome monster slobbering in front of me. I would flip the knives end over end and catch them again, completely disregarding the risk of cutting my hand. But why did I like danger?
For me, danger was exhilarating because it was risky. I could get hurt or even die. Standing at the edge of an abyss would send adrenaline coursing through my veins. Beyond the physical danger, I also found thrill in danger because it mirrored the movies. I was a hero, rescuing a beautiful maiden in distress and defeating the evil villain. The villain was below me, defeated, and I was glowering over him, a bloody knife in my hand. However, is this fun worth the risk? At the time, it was. And to be honest, it sometimes still is.
One day, I was feeling lonely—my brother and sister had just left for debate camp—and looking for fun—the kind of fun that was dangerous and possibly deadly. I tiptoed into my dad's closet, searching for forbidden items. My dad’s closet was a treasure trove of fun objects, including Legos that I couldn’t play with, pellet guns, BB guns, and knives. My eyes landed on his BB gun—No, too big to hide. Then, I spotted two small pocketknives—Perfect! Mom will never notice these in my pocket! I quickly slipped them into my pocket and ran upstairs to my bedroom. But was this the right decision? I knew I wasn’t allowed to have them, so I was deliberately disobeying my parents. Was a little fun worth disobeying my parents?
