Without an understanding of how technology works, how it is developed, and how to implement it into our daily lives, students will inevitably struggle to keep up in what we call the "real world."

coding uses the [scientific method](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-biology-foundations/hs-biology-and-the-scientific-method/a/the-science-of-biology).

Although coding is mostly categorized as a science, there is undoubtedly an element of the arts in it. Effective coding necessitates a certain amount of ingenuity to solve challenges in creative ways.

It makes sense [why they say software developers make the best entrepreneurs](https://skillcrush.com/blog/developers-great-entrepreneurs/). Using the scientific method discussed earlier, coders are able to bring their ideas to life, solve big hairy problems, and make the world a better place for everyone.

It requires creating hypotheses, testing hypotheses, and using logical thinking to fix something that is broken. This is a skill that won’t go out of date and is now more useful than ever. Learning coding and learning debugging moves you from thinking “This is broken,” to “How can I fix that?” Debugging and programming demystify technology — you can now reason about how things are built or how you might build them.

Programming isn't just about making things, it's about understanding how things are made.

And the sense of pride that I felt from completing that first assignment — and the many that followed — was a feeling that subjects like math, English, and science had never provided.
