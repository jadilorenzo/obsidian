Play of a play within a play... (in which we could factiously make as if they were play as animals)

Francis is the director of the play and has changed the lines

Sometimes Hal reads Falstaff's insults directed at himself

Poins (who is also director Francis) steals Falstaff's camera (instead of his horse)

Since Francis changed the lines we can place famous lines at random points:
	I know not why I am sad
	Tis not in the bond (script)
	Come, kiss me kate.
	The better part of valor is discretion

they call for Francis because they don't like the lines

Hal could dress ultra casual (a hoodie or a Hawaiian shirt)
