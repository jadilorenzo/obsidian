“Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.” Ephesians 6:11

MAKING THE CONNECTION

“When I get this really cool device and it can do a gazillion things, one of the things that I really ought to do is read the manual.” -Doug Wilson

Pornography and sexual addiction are unlike many other sins because God has staked his claim in the areas of marriage and sexuality. Men and women were made “in the image of God” (Genesis 1:27), and in our masculinity and femininity, as well as our sexual relationships to one another, we reflect God’s glory. Marriage — and healthy sexuality, in general — are significant battlegrounds because of Paul’s words in Ephesians 5:32: “This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.”

While Paul was speaking directly about marriage, and how husbands and wives interact in a godly way, the larger implication is that sexuality is more than the physical. It’s more than a man and his wife. It’s more than you and your computer screen. Sexuality is spiritual. It communicates gospel truth! And a profound misunderstanding of its spiritual dimension has led many men (and women) down a dark path to slavery. But there is a light up ahead.

God has given us resources — weapons — to wage war against this sin, and conquer it. There are at least two reasons sexual sin is so hard to beat: porn (and perverted ideas about sexuality) are everywhere and readily accessible, and Christians have not been taught discipline and self-control. In other words, porn is everywhere, and Christians don’t know how to fight. But we have the manual; we need to look at the book, see the tools we have at our disposal, and learn how to use them in battle.

GETTING IN THE WORD

Ephesians is a book evenly divided into two halves. The first three chapters are doctrinal, and teach us about the work of Christ; the last three chapters are practical, and teach us how to live now in the light of Christ’s work. In other words, in chapters 4-6 we learn what we should do now as a result of what God has done (chapters 1-3).

Near the end of the letter, after giving instructions to husbands, wives, children, fathers, servants, and masters, Paul returns his attention to all Christians. He wants the church in Ephesus (and us!) to know how to wage war against “the schemes of the devil.” As you prepare to fight for your freedom, here’s how you do it!

Read Ephesians 6:10-17

1. Summarize this passage in a few sentences. Point out things that immediately stand out to you and how they address your sexual sin.

Be strong through Christ's power. Immerse yourself and put on the full armor of God. For we aren't fighting against people, but against spiritual forces. There's the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of peaces, the shield of faith, and the helmet of salvation. Most importantly, take the sword of the Spirit, the word of God.

Read Ephesians 6:10-17 [write out entirety of text]

Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;

2. “Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.” Why does Paul encourage you to be strong in the Lord — not in yourself?  
    What’s happened when you’ve tried to find freedom in your own power?
	Nothing we can do in our own strength can truly profit.
1. In this passage, Paul describes the “armor of God.” What’s the purpose of armor? What happens to a person in battle when they don’t use armor?
	Armor is defensive. If you don't use it you will die.
1. Reread verse 12. What’s another reason our struggle with sin is such a hard-fought battle? How does it make you feel to read that your fight against pornography is ultimately not with yourself and your desires, but against “cosmic powers” and “spiritual forces of evil”?
    
5. Write out all the pieces of the armor of God. Take note of how much of it is defensive and how much is offensive. Why do you think the armor is designed this way?
    
6. Look at the armor again. Paul is intentional in his use of metaphor. Which parts of the armor do you “put on” and why?  
    Which part are you instructed to hide behind and why?  
    How does the use of each piece help you wage war against pornography and sexual sin?
    
7. You have only one piece of armor with which you can launch an attack. How can you wield the sword of the Spirit (the Word of God, the Bible) in your battle against sexual sin?
    

NOW WHAT

Your fight is against cosmic powers, spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. You need powerful weapons in the fight. Aside from holding your armor together with the truth of the gospel, the truth of God’s power, and the truth of his glory in a healthy view of sexuality — you need Christ’s own righteousness to protect your life. Get familiar with the gospel and be ready to share it with other captives. Put on your helmet of salvation; it’s time to go war.

Learn to hide behind your faith as it shields you from the attacks of Satan: thinking God is holding out on you, that you’re missing out on something, or that your addiction can satisfy you in the end. And as you wage war against one of the greatest strongholds the enemy may have in your life, go on the offensive with the Word of God and the other weapon you have — prayer.

Spend the next few days reading and praying through Proverbs 6:20-35. Ask God to help you understand sex the way he intended it. Heed the warnings in this passage, and ask God for wisdom as you put on the armor and go to war with your sin.
